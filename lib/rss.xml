<br>Taking differential balance of A between time instances  and , we get the above 
<br>A reacted in dt should be expressed in terms of volumetric rate of reaction, rate expression and total volume of V, then you write it!
<br>Ra* V is the volumetric rate of reaction
<br><br>
<br>This lovely little lump of metal has an inlet, an outlet and a tank with an agitator
<br>The tank is kept at a lower concentration of the reactant than the inlet fluid has
<br>The liquid in the tank is completely homogenous (fancy word for same throughout)
<br>This is also called the backmix reactor and I personally prefer calling it the backmix reactor
<br>Space time for the reactor is  where V is the reactor volume and  is the inlet flow rate
<br> is the rate for first order,  is constant throughout, so the rate of reaction is also constant
<br>Expansion, also known as -redacted-, is accounted for in the concentrations only, doesn't affect much else
<br><br>
<br>I will cover this on my second reading of the book

this is the same as before, except now we have Delta P different:
<br>
<br>r2 = radius of centrifuge, r1 = radius at which liquid air interface is from the center<br>

<br>we wrote this differently in the other pages, but if you mess with the units about enough, you'll get this
<br>equating the two you get your equation
<br>Area difference between R1 and R2 is usually too small to notice, but if it is big, then use the textbook

"Chemical engineering is a study of a group of industrial processes in which raw materials are converted into useful products"
Example
A plant producing phosphoric acid:

<br>phosphate rock, H2SO4, in a reactor forming 30% acid, rest gypsum
<br>This goes into a crystallizer, then a filtration step - wet product P2O5, lot of gypsum
<br>Then a washing step for the dry product, the wash is then recycled into the reactor
<br>The wet product goes into the dryer, which then gives us  the product<br>

<br>
A unit operation is a basic step in a chemical process that can cause physical changes only

<br>
Adsorption is for gas/liquid solid and absorption is for gas liquid

<br><br>
<br>When a system contains two or more components with different concentrations, there is a natural tendency for a mass to be transferred minimizing the concentration differences.
Important

<br>The transport of one constituent from a region of higher concentration to that of a lower concentration is called as mass transfer



<br>The difference in concentration (or partial pressure) is the driving force.
<br><br>
<br>Diffusive (or molecular) - Occurs in absence of any microscopic motion in the medium. There are two types - molecular and eddy diffusion
<br>Convective (or forced) - Occurs in presence of motion in the medium
<br><br>
<br>Molar flux of species is directly proportional to the concentration gradient in the direction of decreasing concentration
<br>
<br>Applicable for molecular diffusion
<br>Steady state assumption
<br>The factor is an experimental quantity
<br><br>
<br>Simple way of solving practical problems related to complex mixing flows and patterns
<br>mass transfer flux is the rate of mass transfer/area
<br>
<br>The typical value of kc for gas phase is 10^(-2) m/s and for liquid phase it's 10^(-5)
<br><br>
<br>
<br>Molar flux related to stationary observer:
<br>
<br>Molar flux related to observer with any velocity
<br>
<br>-&gt;
<br>
<br>
<br>We can define two cases here - diffusion of A through non diffusing B, the second case is Gas liquid phase where both are diffusing - equimolar counter diffusion
<br>So for the first case B is not diffusing and the second has A and B diffusing at the same rates
<br>N_A is the molar flux of component A, C is total concentration and P is total pressure
<br>
Example<br>
If Nb =0<br>

<br>LMCD is the log mean concentration difference which is analogous to the LMTD In <a data-href="Heat Transfer" href="heat-transfer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Heat Transfer</a><br><br>

 <br>
<br>Control systems are called for 3 general classes of problems: suppressing the influence of external disturbances, ensuring the stability of chemical processes, and optimizing the performance of a chemical process
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250121172447.png" src="pasted-image-20250121172447.png">
<br>I would explain what each variable means but I assume our reader has half a brain to comprehend
<br>The above diagram is how variables in a chemical process control system are classified
<br><br>
<br>Define the control objectives - "what are the operational objectives a control system is called upon to achieve?" -&gt; the answer lies in the three type of problems the control system is called to solve
<br>Select measurements - "what variables should we measure in order to monitor the operational performance of a plant?" -&gt; so these are the measurements you need to be able to make regarding the control objectives of your system. The output variables. The ones that are classified as "measured" are "primary measurements" and "unmeasured" are "secondary measurements"
<br>Select the manipulated variables - "What are the manipulated variables that can be used to control a process?" -&gt; input variables you can change to make a control loop
<br>Select the control configuration
<br>Design the controller - no question here, no selection here, just straight up get programming and soldering
<br><br>
<br>A control configuration is the information structure that is used to connect the available measurements to the available manipulated variables
<br>Depending on number of inputs and outputs, we can distinguish control configurations as single input single output (SISO) or multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
<br>Three general types of control configurations exist:
<br>Feedback control configuration: uses direct measurements of controlled variables to adjust manipulated variables
<br>Inferential control configuration: uses secondary measurements(the controlled variables can't be measured) to adjust the values of manipulated variables. An estimator uses the inputs and outputs to make an estimation of where the controlled variable is at. Sort of like how an inertial navigation machine in airplanes works
<br>Feedforward control configuration: direct measurement of the disturbances to adjust values of manipulated variables
<br><br>
<br>In process control, the hardware used is: process equipment, sensors, transducers (convert signals between analog and digital), transmission lines <a data-href="Intro to CPC" href="intro-to-cpc.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Intro to CPC</a>, controller, final control element, recording elements
<br>the final control element is the hardware that can manipulate a variable<br>

If backmix always needs a larger volume than plug flow for a certain conversion, why not use plug flow all the time? - heat transfer, viscosity, etc

 <br>Under Construction

<br>Need to flesh out the objective and the contents of this page better, along with a few solved problems

<br>
Two approaches - empirical and theoretical. Won't go into what each means because it's obvious
<br>
<br>
In order to characterize a processing system, we need: 

<br>
A set of fundamental dependent quantities whose values will describe the natural state of the system

<br>
A set of equations in the fundamental quantities which will describe how the natural state of the given system changes with time

The book then states the conservation laws as the equations - conservation of mass and energy


<br>
The equations along with the fundamental quantities form a differential equation with time as the independent variable and the fundamental quantities as the dependent variables

<br>
The solution of the differential equation defines the dynamic behaviour of the system

<br><br>
<br>The time between the inputs being changes and the effect viewed in the system is called the dead time or lag time
<br>Real life is never ideal and theres almost always dead time
<br><br>
<br>Pretty simple - a systems outputs expressed as a function of it's inputs
<br>
<br><br>
<br>number of independently variables that can define the process completely
<br>more on this on a later date

C1 to C4 is gases -&gt; natural gas, LPG, NGL, LNG

<br>C5 to C12 -&gt; Gasoline
<br>C10 to C17 -&gt; Kerosene
<br>C15 to C2 -&gt; diesel oil, fuel oil
<br>C22+ -&gt; lube oils


<br>
oily water, mud, sludge and sand are also side products that are disposed or re injected

<br>
Most of the research is still placed around crude oil

<br>
Wherever solid is involved, reproducibility of the batches is very difficult

<br>
when you produce zeolites, the pore size and other factors have a big impact on performance. But since this is so difficult to do, very few companies do it. 

<br>
Zeolites are used as catalysts in the crude oil refinery process
Awareness assignment
What is fluidized catalytic cracking? sintering of catalyst


<br>
once you get all those cracked and not so cracked products from the petroleum industry, you put them to uses in the world and the industry related to applying the stuff from the petroleum industry to the world is the petrochemical industry

<br>
There's a great flowchart of this in the prof's ppt

<br><br>
<br>
Coal gasification big thing

<br>
Anthracite is the best coal

<br>
In india we dont have anthracite, we have lower quality coal
Awareness assignment
What are the sources of natural gases in the world, origin of CNG, how much is burnt out. Also types of coal and where they're found in the world. Also oxo chemistry. What is royal blue


<br>
coal -&gt; coal gasification -&gt; syngas -&gt; fischer tropsch then gives all the different types of fuels, steam and electricity

<br>
coal derived chemicals are from liquefaction and gasification

<br>
Gasification is mostly by reforming
On the two processes
"It's not liquefaction vs gasification, they both give different products... liquefaction and gasification has tremendous potential for replacing petroleum"


<br>
<br>A partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to give H2 and CO for syngas. Extreme process control is required to stop the oxygen from becoming CO2
<br>whatever is recently made is biofuel and whatever was made many millions of years ago is petro. eg. bagasse derived ethanol, sawdust derived ethanol, corn derived ethanol, transesterificatrion of waste cooking oils, sugarcane derived ethanol, vegetable oil, 
<br>In addition to coal and all, edible and non edible vegetable oils are the source of many chemicals.

<br>
A voltage is created between T1 and T2 because of their temperatures and is in the microvolt level

<br>
This is because of the seabeck effect - two junctions, at different temperatures cause a voltage 

<br>
Peltier effect is when you put a voltage, one junction becomes hot and the other becomes cold

<br>
The voltage does not vary linearly with temperature and thus a calibration polynomial must be used

<br>
Thompson effect - voltage generated due to temperature gradient between two points

<br>
The smallest change in temperature for which a change in voltage takes place is the resolution of the sensor.
Important

<br>Resolution is the smallest change in the variable for which a change can be detected
<br>Sensitivity is how big of a change in signal is caused due to a unit change in a variable
<br>Note the difference 



<br>
Accuracy - how close the measurement is to the true value. Error = Actual Value - Measured Value

<br>
The time a sensor takes to give the measurement is called the dynamic lag. Like when you put a thermometer in your mouth, it takes some time to give the temperature. The time this takes is called the dynamic lag. How fast my system responds to the change

<br>
Precision is the reproducibility of your measurement

<br>DIfferent mixing techniques - dry blending
<br>Extrusion techniques - basic twin screw and single screw
<br>
A polymer is a substance composed of long sequences of one or more species of atoms or groups of aton of polymers
<br>
When you can mold a polymer in any shape, its known as plastic. It should be processable
<br>
<br>DIfferent mixing techniques - dry blending
<br>Extrusion techniques - basic twin screw and single screw
<br>ms linked together by primary, usually covalent bonds<br>
n of polymers<br>
<br>DIfferent mixing techniques - dry blending
<br>Extrusion techniques - basic twin screw and single screw
<br>Usually two plastics are mixed to make blends to make one with exactly the properties one wants<br>
PET - poly(ethylene terepthalate) is a blend of PE and PT<br>
<br>blends differ from composites in the sense that composites have one material that is reinforcing mechanically
<br>both blends and composites are binary phase mix
<br>Danger
The history is NOT IN THE SYLLABUS (i think)
<br><br>
<br>1820 -&gt; This guy, Thomas Hancock, found a way to blend additives to rubber (a natural polymer) by beating it up (masticating it)         <img alt="Pasted image 20240713172639.png" src="pasted-image-20240713172639.png">
<br>1839 -&gt; Charles Goodyear added sulphur to rubber and found it got stronger. This process was named vulcanization.
<br>1846 - 1870 -&gt; Some guy prepared nitrocellulose, sold it as an explosive. Another guy thought to mold it and make items out of it as it was found it be a hard elastic material that is also soluble and easily mold-able. Two other guys thought it would be smart to do this with something that isn't an explosive - celluloid. Instant commercial success.
<br>1892 -&gt; Cross, Bevan and Beadle patented the viscose process for dissolving and regenerating cellulose
<br>1920s -&gt; This absolute chad of a human, Hermann Staudinger studied the synthesis, structure and properties of polyoxymethylene and polystyrene to give emprical evidence of his idea that polymers are really just macromolecules  containing large sequences of monomers. Everyone doubted him, but the haters were proven wrong

 <br>
<br>The general form of the transfer function of a second order system is:
<br>When C&gt;1, its overdamped, C=1 critically damped and C&lt;1 underdamped
go through the cases in the book and report the formulae here

<br>
<br>overdamped systems literally damp out all the sin and cos stuff, underdamped, you still see some oscillation and critically damped systems are in between the two
<br><br>
<br>responses exhibit overshoot (y(t)/KM&gt;1)
<br>Larger values of C exhibit a slow sluggish response
<br>When C goes lower, the oscillatory behaviour increases
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250128110701.png" src="pasted-image-20250128110701.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250128110823.png" src="pasted-image-20250128110823.png">
<br>overshoot = 
<br>decay ratio = 
<br>time taken to get to  is called the rise time
<br>overshoot is how much the response exceeds the ultimate value following a step change
<br>decay ratio is defined as the square of the sizes of the successive peaks
<br>decay ratio = 
<br><br>
<br>
<br>Substituting i\omega: The magnitude of this term is the AR (amplitude ratio)
<br>This is done to get the frequency response of the system on a sinusoidal (?) input
<br>Substitute this in second order and you get the amplitude ratio
<br>This be'eth a trick
<br>So you basically substitute  in the s in the transfer function and the magnitude of the complex number that comes out is the amplitude ratio
<br>phase lag is  where Y is the imaginary component of the complex number that comes out when you substitute i omega and X is the real component
<br>so the final results for the AR and phase for second order is:

 <br>
Distillation columns contain a number of units connected to each other, called stages. This note explains the terminology and logic behind them
<br>Question
What are the process parameters at every stage? does that matter? Like what is the pressure and temperature at stage n? Why do we not care about it?

<br><br>
<br>The stages are numbered using the flow of liquid as the direction. Liquid (usually...) flows downward, so the last stage (of N stages) is the  stage
<br>streams flowing out of a unit are subscripted with the number of the stage that it flows out of
<br>eg. 
<br><br>
<br>Two types of material balances here - component balance and total material balance
<br>Total balance: 
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250120102025.png" src="pasted-image-20250120102025.png">
<br>Material balance of the whole column:  where a and b are the components A and B
<br>component balance: 
<br>where x and y are the mole fractions in the liquid and vapour phase of whichever component you're component-balancing
<br><br>
<br>
<br>Assuming the process is workless and adiabatic
<br><br>
<br>A way of showing the compositions of two phases of the cascades in an x-y diagram
<br>This is found through component balance:
<br>
<br>=&gt;
<br>If the Ln/V{n+1} remains constant throughout the column, we get a straight operating line, if not, then we gotta make the curvee
<br>This is legit just material balance
<br>So what they end up doing is assuming the stripping or rectification section is just one stage

thermo plastics can be classified in three types - commodity, specialty and engineering

<br>
in commodity thermoplastics you have polyolefins, further classified into two types - polyethylene and polypropylene.

 <br><a href=".?query=tag:polymers" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#polymers</a> Rubbers, Plastics and Resins<br>
<br>
Plastic - you can easily melt and process plastic and is usually given in pellet form. Mostly thermoplastic

<br>
Resin - may be in the form of liquid or powder. Cure The granules are added then wetting agent then powder at the end. The wetting agent isn't added in the end because this would cause the powder to be clumped up togetherd then never can be reprocessed. Mostly thermoset

<br>
Engineering, specialty and commodity polymers fall under plastics

<br>
Resins are those which are naturally or synthetic - applications in paints, coatings

<br>
Engineering, Specialty polymers and commodity polymers

<br>
commodity polymers are used in day to day usage* The granules are added then wetting agent then powder at the end. The wetting agent isn't added in the end because this would cause the powder to be clumped up together

<br>
Engineering polymers used in engineering applications on the basis of application

<br>
Specialty polymers used in niche applications like aerospace or aviation

<br>
ON the basis of chemical nature is thermoplastic and thermoset

<br>
to classify a polymer you must use it's nature, occurrence and application

<br>
example - PET is a commodity thermoplastic synthetic material

<br>
blends are binary mixtures of polymers. composites are binary mixtures used in reinforcement systems, blends are all other mixtures, filled plastics are also binary phases

<br>
composites are only for mechanical properties

<br>
filled plastics - when you put in a filler, pigment

<br><br>
<br>they are black because of carbon black which is added in the rubber
<br>the black causes a higher frictional factor
<br>the carbon black is very conductive - its good at dissipating the frictional (adiabatic) heat that is transferred into the tyre
<br>the black causes good weather resistance - weatherability. Good resistance toward UV
<br><br>
<br>Dyes are medium (example: water) soluble, pigments are not soluble in mediums
<br>Pigments are used in polymer engineering
<br><br>
<br>solutions cause the solute and solvent to be in a single phase
<br>dispersion is a state of mixture when the substances won't settle or float(go up or down)
<br>emulsion is a state of mixture when it's added binary phase but becomes single phase with surface tension effects

this section to be updated


<br><br>A-B-C<br>
if we suppose the above is a representation of a molecule, B is the compatible-izer since it causes a link between A and C to occur. Without B, this would have not happened. It makes A and C compatible<br>
This is for any system.<br>
In polymerization reactions, catalysts are used as compatiblizers<br><br>
<br>Viscosity is the resistance to flow
<br>Materials that thin when you shear them, are non newtonian (viscosity reduces with shear). Polymers are non newtonian
<br>Since they thin when we add shear, it's more processable
<br>it's a function of temperature and pressure. Any change in either of these variables will cause a change in viscosity

<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20240714152959.png" src="pasted-image-20240714152959.png"><br>
<br>Based on the identities of the monomers making up the polymer, we classify them as homopolymers and copolymers
<br>Homopolymers are made up of a single repeating unit and are represented by  where A is the repeating unit. The proper way to name these is to use 'poly' then write the chemical name for the repeating unit

Is sugar manufacture a sustainable activity in India?<br>
Jaggery is easier to manufacture than crystalline sugar however, it is still more expensive than sugar. This is due to economies of scale<br>
The question to the JPC (?) is whether we should allow the sugar industry to flourish the way it is right now.<br>
Water recovery is the only problem with the sugar industry in india right now. If the water is not recovered, the process is not sustainable

Biorefractory - not amenable for biological treatment


<br>
First thing that is done to the effluent is skimming the oil off the wash

<br>
This is because oil is not very easily biodegradable

<br>
The first water wash has a lot of coca butter, which is the oil

<br>
Then the oil is cleaved and added back to the effluent, because now it's easy to break down

The above notes are from my professor's perspective, what he taught in class. The following is what I understand of thermodynamics. I may be wrong
<br>
<br>An addition to what was said in the introduction of the previous part - The reason we study thermodynamics as chemical engineers. The heat machines are briefly discussed to give awareness, if we were to go deeper into it, we'd be looking at valves, rotation, clearances - the more technical aspects. Here we summarize all those components as S_{gen}, not to understand how they work, but to understand their effects. The two types of problems, then that we'd be equipped to solve would be - understanding the best case scenario for a certain situation and analysing a real situation and quantifying the inefficiencies. 
<br>The real stuff we're supposed to learn are mixtures. The number of mixtures out there is in the trillions, very few have had their properties scientifically measured, so a lot of the work we chemical engineers have to do to design a new reactor, or tank is with mixtures that havent been previously studied. Thermodynamics here simply helps us extrapolate from data accurately to get to the mixture properties of any substances at any temperature and pressure.

Related to <a data-href="Entropy" href="entropy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entropy</a>
<br>The requirement for this arises from linear algebra, of all things... <br>
<br>We have the mass balance, energy balance equations. These two are used to solve for two variables, which determine all the other variables in a state. Sometimes, these two equations aren't enough to determine the equilibrium conditions, here, a third equation, entropy balance is used - this is for a single phase, isolated system, multiphase is covered later
<br>Also, the first two equations don't say much about what "can or cant" happen - they do, but there's still another constraint we need. A rock could instantly lower it's temperature and jump up by itself, and that would be alright if we just looked at energy and mass balances. This is why we need entropy balance.
<br>In essence, we have nothing to describe equilibrium, and it's state in a system. Mass and energy balance are OK with any state as long as those two aren't violated.
<br>
Entropy is a state function. In a system in which there are flows of heat by conduction and flow of work across system boundaries, the conductive heat flow and not the work flow, causes a change in entropy of a system; This rate of change in entropy is Q/T where Q is the rate of heat conducted and T is the temperature. If in addition, there are mass flows at the boundaries, the total entropy will also change due to this convected flow. That is, each element of mass entering or leaving the system carries with it it's entropy
<br>The equation, S, on the left hand side is the total entropy, while S on the right hand side (not S_gen), is the entropy per unit mass(couldnt figure out how to use carets in latex). S_gen is the entropy generated in the system due to inefficiencies, and must always be equal to or above 0<br>
<br>S_gen is the entropy created in a system, since this always must be above or equal to 0, the presence of it causes irreversibility. Irreversibility in the sense that the system is now forever different to what it was a moment ago, we can never turn back the clock and reduce entropy because S_gen can never be below 0. So unless it is equal to 0 all the time, the system will never go back to what it used to be. 
<br>Important
 Something funny that NO ONE says in class - all irreversibility can be traced back to conduction - viscous conduction. Even movement due to a finite pressure difference is irreversible purely because of viscous conduction due to friction. :/ This makes entropy so much easier to understand - its ALL heat conduction
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241103164321.png" src="pasted-image-20241103164321.png"><br>
<br>Interesting consequence - reversible processes extracting work from the system to give to the surroundings, maximum work is done for a given change of state of the system (because so little energy is lost to conduction), the processes giving work to the system for a change of state require the least amount of work for it

<br><br>
<br>This is a cycle - you got the condenser, the evaporator, the nozzle and the compressor. The compressor puts work in the system, makes the fluid high pressure, liquid. The nozzle causes isentropic (not really) expansion, condenser releases heat to the surroundings, evaporator absorbs heat from the cooled substance. 
<br>The trick to refrigeration which I wasn't able to get in <a data-href="Entropy" href="entropy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entropy</a>, is that the heat put in from the cold side and the heat released into the hot side isnt the same, the heat in the hot side is the cold side+ work shaft

This topic is extremely simple. The simplest topic in the simplest chapter
<br>
<br>Occurs when the <a data-href="functionality" href="functionality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">functionality</a> is 2.
Example
I don't have any addon for chemical reaction display so bear with me
terepthalic acid (benzene with two carboxylic acids in para position)+ ethylene glycol (ethane but one hydrogen on each carbon is replaced with a hydroxyl group) -&gt; ester with a hydroxyl group on one end and a carboxylic acid group on the other end.
This molecule, if you haven't already noticed, is also difunctional


<br>Linear step polymerizations can be represented by:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>and a bunch of other combinations the the above terms. The R is basically the everything in the molecule but the functional group and the letters A and B represent the functional groups. There are clearly two functional groups on each representation above. If two of the same letter are on R , like , it means both the functional groups are the same, like in ethylene gylcol or terepthalic acid. ARB means the functional groups on the molecule are different and the molecule basically reacts with itself
<br>A and B are mutually reactive
<br><br><br>
<br>Happens when carboxylic acid or acid halide reacts with alcohol group
<br>Reaction between the carboxylic acid and the alcohol groups is slow and has to be done in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, at 80-300C
<br>Almost always RA2+RB2, sometimes ARB
Todo
Ask someone when relevant and not offputting, why it's not called ARB for even RA2+RB2 reactions since they produce an ARB molecule


<br>Example
dicarboxylic acid with any divalent group holding it+diol with any divalent group holding it -&gt; polyester +water
<br><br>
<br>Happens when a dicarboxylic acid reacts with di-amine
<br>This is analogous to polyester formation and this we won't discuss the mechanism and equation further
<br>Aliphatic polyamides are called nylons and are mostly formed by RA2+RB2 polycondensation

A question may come on the difference between thermoplastics and thermoset plastic - just a feeling


<br><br>
<br>Polymers with aromatic groups in the chain's backbone have better mechanical properties and some are made by polycondensation:
<br><br>
<br>on reaction of an amine and a di-acyl chloride molecule - what is formed? - Polyurea is formed Polyamides are formed. They are formed by the removal of HCl as condensation. The reaction is an RA+RB polycondensation
<br>On reaction of a di-isocyanate with an amine, you get polyurea. Polyurea is formed by addition on the N atom and re-arrangement of the hydrogen atom to the oxygen atom in the isocyanate

<br>
The logistic model. We fit B0 and B1 to the data

<br>
A method of maximum likelihood is used to fit the model

<br>
This function will always produce an S shaped curve

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241112093716.png" src="pasted-image-20241112093716.png">

<br>
the above is the function that is to be maximized to get B0 and B1
Important
Dedicate some time to p values and hypothesis testing


<br>
Multiple logistic regressions are also possible, just a small extension of normal logistic regression, however keep in mind that each variable can only have two settings, in other words, it's binomial

<br>
Multinomial logistic regressions solve this - <img alt="Pasted image 20241112112735.png" src="pasted-image-20241112112735.png">

<br>
this is the normal encoding. If the output has K classes, and p predictors. The regression uses K-1 classes, the Kth class is pretty much implied

<br>
The softmax encoding is the symmetric version of this<img alt="Pasted image 20241112112813.png" src="pasted-image-20241112112813.png">

<br>
This uses all K classes

Softmax encoding is used a lot in machine learning

 <br><a href=".?query=tag:polymers" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#polymers</a><br>
<br>You process a polymer at it's processing temperature. In case of polymers the processing temperature is above it's melting temperature
<br>To reduce the resistance of the material, you need to increase the temperature above the melt temperature to reduce viscosity. Generally about 10C higher than melting point
<br>Polymer processing is done for application, study of properties and to reduce the cost of a compound by adding a filler or use a cheaper material along with the polymer
<br>First part of processing is called dry blending then melt blending. Not strictly a requirement
<br><br>
<br>Dry blending -  You don't allow the polymer to melt when processing. Example - you have one powder phase and one pellet/granular phase and they're just mixed up. Can't be regularly agitated since the powder will separate from the granules due to difference in density. Oily phase to be added to the mixture so the powder is tied to the granules. The oily phase is called a wetting agent and that causes adsorption/ soaking of the powder on the granule.
<br>The granules are added then wetting agent then powder at the end. The wetting agent isn't added in the end because this would cause the powder to be clumped up together
<br>When you're mixing in a tumbler, the rpm you choose is important. The optimized speed is a problem. The RPM where you're getting a constant bulk density is the optimum speed
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240802100231.png" src="pasted-image-20240802100231.png">
<br>To know when something is properly mixed you sample and check the bulk density. The bulk density is measured using a British cylinder
<br>Melt blending - Melt 'n Mix after making a uniform dry blend as written above. It's not mandatory all the time to have dry then melt processing, you can go directly to melt by using feeders. 
<br><br>
<br>
Extrusion is a continuous output with positive displacement.

<br>
A cycle air pump is not an extruder since it retracts and this it is not continuous

<br>
A screw is used to extrude polymer to have a continuous positive displacement

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240802100254.png" src="pasted-image-20240802100254.png">

<br>
To increase the mixing, you must reduce the distance between the screw and the barrel. This has the consequence of reducing the mass flow

<br>
Should the shear profile be constant or profile(non constant) through the extrusion? It shouldn't because it wouldnt be mixed properly if it was

<br>
You mostly use thermoplastic in an extruder

<br>
Screw has 3 zones - feed zone, compression/transition zone and the metering zone(?)

<br>
Screw will be tapered (thicker toward the end)

<br>
feed zone you're feeding the material from the hopper. It's only there to convey the material

<br>
Compression zone is for intensive shear mixing of the polymer to be extruded

<br>
metering zone is to push the mixed polymer through a die (the stuff that extrudes it)

<br>
L/D ratio of the screw is the ratio of the screw groove diameter to the length of the screw

<br>
the clearance of the screw is different at different zones. Feed zone the clearance is high. end of the compression zone the clearance is low and the metering zone it's constant at low. Clearance is the distance between the end of the grove of the screw and the wall of the extruder
Todo
understand how the clearance changes between different parts and why. Actually just study all of extrusion from somewhere


<br>
compression ratio:

<br>


<br>
RPM of the screw cant vary

<br>
Temperature will not be constant throughout, the temperature at the feed zone is less and the temperature as you go ahead increases to slowly melt and mix and extrude it

<br>
If the temperature at the feed zone is high, the extruder will get clogged as the stuff will stick to the screw when it melts

Extrusion is a positive displacement technique. Considered to be an adiabatic technique and every zone is isothermal (the temperature doesn't variably change, it is fixed at the melt temperature at non feed zones). Metering zone has screen plate (mesh) and breaker plate(supports the screen plate) right before the die. The screen plate is to restrict unmelted polymer. Breaker plate converts turbulent to laminar flow. 


<br>
There are three types of flows in an extruder - the drag flow (dragged by the screw), pressure flow (pressure from the screen and breaker plate, causing backflow, better mixing) and leakage flow (clearance leakage)
Danger
compression ratio has nothing to do with actual pressure - it's just a metric for mixing


<br><br>
<br>Single motor, two screws, parallel, no tapered design. Screws both move clockwise, there will be pressure buildup since the screws are different directionally threaded (co-rotating). Co rotating has a bad shear profile but good mixing
<br>It also be non - corotating - counter rotating. The screws both move in different directions and the mixture flows in an infinite symbol shape. counter rotating has a better shear profile but bad mixing and bad distribution of filler in extruded material
<br>Danger
Shear profile and rate are NOT THE SAME. Counter rotating has a better shear profile but not shear rate apparently
<br>
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240823094343.png" src="pasted-image-20240823094343.png">
<br>It can be non intermeshing(?) also 
<br>It provides better mixing compared to single screw extruder
<br>Segmented screw has different types of screws in the shaft so you can add different types of screws at different zones as required
Important
Distributing mixing: distributes small particles<br>
Dispersive mixing: dispereses big particles

<br>Polymers are always covalently bonded
<br>With high inductive effect, low molar mass molecules are liberated as the electronegative group abstracts hydrogen from the carbon
<br>Primary bonding - covalent and ionic
<br>Secondary - Configuration and conformation
<br>Configuration - you cant change this without breaking the bonds
<br>Conformation - this is related to the rotation of the bonds
<br>Tacticity - relating to the stereochemistry of repeating units
<br>Tacticity - isotacticity, atacticity and syndiostereotacticity
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240927093303.png" src="pasted-image-20240927093303.png">
<br>The above is isotactic
<br>Glass transition temperature - when you heat the polymer, there is a transition phase, called glass transition. Mostly polymers are semicrystalline or amorphous - glass transition is when the polymer is in amorphous state. The lower this temperature, the more flexible the polymer is. Used in thermoplastic. Above , polymer is flexible and below it it is glassy.  is the temperature below which the polymer is mostly rigid
<br>Tg causes a second order phase change
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241004101559.png" src="pasted-image-20241004101559.png">
<br>The  is the temperature when the specific volume vs temperature graph has a change in slope
<br>DSC - differential scanning calorimetry, can find the , , , gel point, everything
<br>DMTA - dynamic mechanical and thermal analysis
<br>DSC and DMTA are two techniques to get the  value
<br>Melting temperature - Used in thermoplastic. 
<br>Melting temperature - related to heat gain
<br>Crystallization temperature,  - Used in thermoplastic. When you cool the polymer it starts crystallizing. When the entropy change is the highest - peak crystallization temperature
<br>Semi crystalline polymer shows ,  and . Amorphous only shows 
<br>Semi Crystalline polymers is defined by how regular the packing of the polymer is. 
<br>Amorphous Polymers have a completely irregular packing
<br>Gel point - Used in thermoset. When the degree of polymerization of a thermoset tends to infinity
<br>Curing temperature - Used in thermoset. When the polymer cures
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241004103217.png" src="pasted-image-20241004103217.png">
<br>in conformation you have gauch, trans and eclipsed
<br>isotactic means that if it's arranged in a regular pattern
<br>in polymerization there are three types of configuration - cis or trans - cis will give better machanical properties - also called diene polymerization, strereoregularity - tacticity, configuration based on structure - head to head, tail to tail or head to tail
<br>head to head and tail to tail dont occur much, mostly head to tail
<br><br>
<br>Tg more flexible above. Dis be'eth a mechanical property
<br><br>
<br>In case of polymers, there are two types of crystals - lamella, and spherulites
<br>Lamella - forms around the nucleation point, the chain folds
<br>The many lamella form spherulite, spherulites are big spherical crystals
<br>If the rate of cooling is high, crystals arent formed well. Slow rate of cooling forms good polymers
<br><br>
<br>dialatency - shear thickening
<br>Shear thinning - pseudoplasticity

Make a list of all pipe fittings. Application of all valves. Print/ draw freehand.
<br>Problem
A reverse osmosis unit for purifying brackish water has 900000 fibres that permit the diffusion of water but reject most of the salt. The fibres are 85 micro meter in outside diameter , 42 micrometers in inside diameter and 3 ft long. The average flow through the tubes is 2000 gallons of water per day when the feed pressure is 400 psig. What is the pressure drop within an individual fibre from the feed end to the discharge end?Assume fluid viscosity = 1cP
<br><br><br>Bug
Water flows through an 8 inch steel pipe at an average velocity of 6 feet/second. Downstream the pipe divides into an 8 inch main and a 2 inch bypass. The equivalent length of the bypass is 22 feet. Length of the 8 inch pipe in the bypassed section is 16 feet. Neglecting entrance and exit losses, what fraction of total flow passes through the bypass
<br>Solution
take point 1 as the end of the bypass and take point 2 as the end of the main<br>
Get x2 in terms of x and then get v_1 in terms of x and then multiply that with the respective areas and boom boom bam you get the answer<br>

<br>the mean squared error in models shows the accuracy

<br>the bias of the function squared, variance of the function and variance of the irreducible error term
<br>variance of the function is how much the prediction of some x0 would change if we estimated it on different datasets, same with the error term's variance
<br>In general, more flexible methods have more more variance. You would see deep learning have a higher variance than linear regression
<br>bias is the error that is because we're estimating a real life problem. Its the difference between what we got vs whats actually there
<br>Usually, with more flexible methods, bias initially decreases,hits a hard bottom, then variance starts to increase
<br>So basically if bias is high, you dont have a model that understands your data at all
<br>If your variance is high, you've overfit and cant use your model to extrapolate
<br>Mostly, when the bias decreases, variance increases and vice versa

<br>Equivalent diameter for the annular space is equal to inner diameter of the outer pipe - inner diameter of the inner pipe

<br>
These guys tried to derive a general equation for pressure drop across packed beds

<br>
They began with getting an analogy between streamline flow in an empty pipe and a packed pipe

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925090907.png" src="pasted-image-20240925090907.png">

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925091658.png" src="pasted-image-20240925091658.png">

<br>
If free space between particles is assumed to consist of a series of tortuous channels, the hagen poiseuille equation can be rewritten as:

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925091938.png" src="pasted-image-20240925091938.png">

<br>
where K1 is a function of the bed structure, and is a dimensionless constant

<br>
Ltube is actually L1 here and is the length of tortuous channel
Faq
What is a tortuous channel?<br>
randomly formed channels


<br>
The length of a tortuous channel will be higher than the actual length of the pipe.

<br>
V1 and L1 represent conditions in the pores and are not the same as v_avg and packing length. Both will be higher than their normal values

<br>
It is assumed that at any length the length of a tortuous path will be directly proportional to length of a tube

<br>
d1 is the equivalent diameter of the tortuous pore space

<br>
Kozeny said d1 = <img alt="Pasted image 20240925093749.png" src="pasted-image-20240925093749.png">

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925094112.png" src="pasted-image-20240925094112.png">

<br>
K2 accounts for the proportionality between L1 and Ltube and we can use Ltube since we know only Ltube not L1

<br>
180 = k^2*S

<br>
Modified friction factor is R/pv^2

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925100350.png" src="pasted-image-20240925100350.png">

<br>
R1 is drag force, rho is density and v is v1

<br>
for flow to occur, pressure drop is required.

<br>
This pressure drop should be exactly equal to the resistance faced by the fluid

<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240925101524.png" src="pasted-image-20240925101524.png">

<br>


<br>
The above is a fitted correlation for packed beds by carman

<br>
It's similar to the equation proposed by Forchheimer, who suggested that resistance to flow should be considered in two parts:

<br>
Viscous force at particle surface

<br>
Loss in turbulent eddies and at sudden changes in cross section of channels, therefore

<br>


<br>
The first term predominates at low flow rates where losses are mainly due to skin friction

<br>
Second term predominates at high flow rates and in very thin beds where the enlargement and contraction losses become very important. AT very high flow rates the effects of viscous forces are negligible

<br>
For Re &lt; 2, second term = 0, hence

<br>


<br>
Learn the derivation of the Forchheimer equation

<br>
Sawitowski proposed for flow of fluids through hollow packings:

<br>


<br>
Note the lack of 0.4 on the numerator of the second term

<br>
For flow through ring packings, another relation was created (semi empirical):

<br>


<br>
This is analogous to hejun poisuelle equation

<br>
Using 6/S, it transforms to something else

<br>
This is not worth remembering and thus I wont write about it here

<br>
All these equations will be provided in the exam
Important
Prof's recommendation - When designing a packed bed column there are softwares that fit a curve on the packed column readings and get you a relation

<br>Darcy showed that average velocity was directly proportional to  and inversely proportional to bed thickness
<br>This is expressed as Darcy's law:
<br>
<br>The linear relation between flow rate and pressure indicates that the flow is laminar
<br>This is because the reynolds number through the pore spaces is low
<br>Resistance to flow arises mainly from viscous drag:
<br>
<br>B is the permeability coefficient. It's completely dependent on the properties of the packed bed

In real life, flow isn't always laminar, it can also be turbulent with a high enough head. Many scientists have developed turbulent derived equations

<br>As chemical engineers, we assume everything is a circular cross section in a pipe. When in reality it is not, we use equivalent diameter to get it's cross sectional area

 <br>
<br>A fluid cannot be fluidized
<br>Fluidised beds were known only to academicians for many years, until adoption of fluidized catalysts by the petroleum industry
<br>Fluidized beds behave as a single fluid of density equal to that of mixture of solids
<br>It is assumed in fluidized beds that one phase is a solid
The danger of saying today
Some drunk johnny boy was taking round and met his commanding officer. His commanding officer was sober. Johnny boy wrote in his diary, "today, my commanding officer was not drunk". Think on the danger of this statement


<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241008110607.png" src="pasted-image-20241008110607.png"><br>
<br>Fluidised catalytic bed reactors
<br>fluidisation - make solids behave as if they were liquid. The upward thrust should be exactly and equal to the downward force
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241008111251.png" src="pasted-image-20241008111251.png">
<br>The above graph is the effect of fluid velocity on pressure gradient and delta P
<br>So basically this shows how the friction factor changes with velocity
<br>When fluidisation just starts, its called minimum or incipient fluidisation
<br>The del P per unit length decreases on start of fluidisation since the length increases since the particles move upwards
<br>In fluidization you do not want to carry away the solids.
<br>When a fluid flows slowly upwards through a bed of very fine particles, the flow is streamline and a linear relation exists between the pressure gradient and flow rate
<br>If log(delP/Ltube) is plotted against log(Vavg), a straight line of slope 1 is obtained
<br>In a fluidised bed, total frictional force on particles = effective weight of bed
<br>Thus in a bed of cross sectional area A, depth Ltube, and porosity epsilon, additional pressure drop across bed due to layout weight of particles is given by:
<br>
<br>The area cancels out
<br>This relationship applies between the initial expansion of the bed till the transport of the bed

<br>Sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241008121052.png" src="pasted-image-20241008121052.png">
<br>Discrepancies between calculated and measured velocities are - channeling, electrostatic forces, agglomeration, friction between fluid and walls of the vessels and friction between particles hitting the walls
<br>Channeling results in drag force reducing
<br>Agglomeration - particles come together
<br>Higher the density difference more are the chances of irregularities in the channels

<br>


<br>
Range of the above is 40,000 to 400,000. Epsilon/D shows the roughness, and this should be between 0 and 0.05

If the roughness is too much, replace the pipe instead of getting a new correlation

 <br>
<br>At the point of incipient fluidisation, equations for packed bed flow are applicable.
<br>Take a look at the carman kozeny equation and the packed bed equation
<br>
<br>This was derived after substituting the delta P from fluidization in the carman kozeny equation
<br>
<br>A value of 3.36 rather than 5 for the carman kozeny constant is used - it matches the experimental data better
<br>minimum fluidisation velocity is given by: 
<br>the value of epsilon mf is a function of the size distribution, shape and surface properties of the particles - its the voidage lol
<br>for turbulent flow, use the ergun equation:
<br>
<br>dp = diameter of the sphere having the same V/S ratio as the actual particles
<br>substituting the delta P in the above equation:
<br>
<br>
<br>this is after multiplying both sides with:

 <br><br>
<br>There are two types of models that estimate f,parametric and non parametric
<br>parametric approaches basically get the problem of f down to a certain number of parameters that must be found. The model is decided from before hand and the parameters are optimized for the error
<br>Parametric methods must assume the form of f before fitting, this causes issues - what if f isn't actually that?
<br>parametric methods need less data compared to nonparametric methods for the same task
<br>eg. linear regressions cant be used to predict the shape of a projectile

<br>
There are two approaches for pressure drop through fittings

<br>
one is using the fanning friction factor

<br>
fanning friction factor is a function of reynold's number, but then for fittings how do you know the reynolds number? what is the diameter of a valve? It's difficult to imagine, You end up using the reynold's number of the pipe fitted on the fitting and you get the equivalent length of the fitting and use the equation:

<br>


<br>
In the L_e/D appr* equationoach (equivalent length approach), a reported literature value of L_E/D is selected. Multiply this value by the diameter of the pipe in which the fitting is involved to get equivalent length.

<br>
Equivalent pipe is the same length of straight pipe required to have the same pressure drop

Underlining everything is underlining nothing - M.M. Sharma


<br>
Other approach is the head coefficient approach

<br>


<br>


<br>
The first part is the head loss coefficient and is denoted by K:

<br>


<br>
This is called number of velocity head approach

<br>
Darcy friction factor is 4 times fanning friction factor. This is because he was french and everyone hates the french.

<br>
When flow dividing or flow merging is required you need a T joint

<br>
Non return swing check valves have a service life and should be services regularly

 <br>Example
It is proposed to pump 10,000kg/hr of toluene at 114 C and 1.1atm absolute pressure from the reboiler of a distillation column of a second distillation unit without cooling the toluene before it enters the pump. If the friction loss in the line between the reboiler and pump is 7kN/m^2 and the density of toluene is 866 KG/M3, how far above the pump must be the liquid level in the reboiler be maintained to give a net positive suction head of 2.5m
<br><br>reboiler is boiling point and if the toluene is boiling there and thus the vapour pressure is 1.1atm<br>
What be-eth the power? <br>
<br>the toluene goes up 10m, frictional losses are: 35kN/m3

pump head is 1499.85 metres
<br><br>Problem
During a trip to the beach.  = 1atm, a car runs out of gas,It becomes necessary to siphon gas out of the tank of a good samaritan. The siphon is a small diameter hose and to start the siphon it becomes necessary to insert one end in the full gasoline tank, fill the hose with gasoline via suction and then place the other end in the gasoline can below the level of the gasoline tank. The difference in pressure between point 1 and point 2 causes the liquid to flow from higher to lower elevation. Point 2 is located 0.75 meter below point 1. Point 3 is located 2m above point 1. So the liquid flows from point 1 to 3 finally to 2. Frictional losses are to be disregarded. Diameter of hose is 4mm.
Determine:

<br>Time to take to move 4 litres into the can
<br>Pressure at point 3. Assume gasoline density to be <br>

Take the tank as point 0, the pressure at 0 and 2 are the same, thus:<br>

 <br>wp is work of pump per unit volume<br>
theres also alpha at the velocity heads that is multiplied. I don't know what it stands for<br>
<br>
What is suction head? When there is no movement, there is P_1 and P_2 at the two points because of possibly height difference 

<br>
P_1 and H_1 exist regardless of flow, but if the pump is not on, the v_1 is 0

We are talking about inherently failproof design.


<br>
There is no suction in centrifugal pumps, but in reciprocating pumps, there is a suction power. This is why the centrifugal pump needs a little head value to get going.
Tldr
Centrifugal pump just sucks at sucking and thus needs a little energy to get the fluid to keep the suction side flooded. This is not a problem with reciprocating pumps because they're better at sucking (in all areas, theyre just bad pumps and they make so much noise)


<br>
We must subtract vapour pressure from the suction head to get the net positive suction head. This is because the vapour potential head is negligible so we do a vapour correction. This net positive suction head must be more than 0. The vapour be eating into our head cus del h has gas density negligible so it becomes P+rho g  (h-hgas) hgas comes from bubble formation

<br>
We subtract to remove any remote possibility of the suction head suffering from the vapour pressure. MINUS DA FRICTIONAL LOSSES ALSO BROO The suction head cannot suffer!!

<br>
net positive suction head for bigger pumps is 7-10 meters and for smaller pumps it's 3-4 meters. 

<br>
NPSH has nothing to do with the delivery side which is the RHS

<br>
When you buy a pump, they give a rating for the pump discharge which is the head for any fluid, not just water

<br>To measure flow rate, we need , and this must be measurable
Historically accurate story
Two italians eating pizza on sicily islands and they generally discuss flow measurement. They realized that without flow measurement, life is nothing. The italians then solved the problem of flow measurement. The two italians were Venturi and Bernoulli


<br>The points between pressure measurement are so small that frictional losses are negligible
<br>The venturi coefficient is a measurement of frictional losses

<br>Outlet angle is less than inlet so that the divergent flow doesn't cause vortices
<br>The narrow middle part is the throat
<br>There are 3 tappings, one at the converging area, one at the throat and one at the divergent section. The divergent area is the pressure recovery section
<br>Using (1) here, we can get the velocity difference at the two points
<br>Point 1 is sufficiently upstream, while point 2 is at the midpoint of the throat or end of the throat
<br>Use equation of continuity:

<br>Absorbance - the attenuation of photons as they pass through a sample
<br>Absorbance spectrum - A graph of a sample's absorbance of electromagnetic radiation versus wavelength
<br>Emission - The release of a photon when an analyte returns to a lower energy state from a higher energy state
<br>Photoluminescence - emission following absorption of a photon
<br>Chemilumninescence - Emission induced by a chemical reaction
<br>Emission - graph of emission intensity versus wavelength

<br>Spectroscopy needs energy, absorption and scattering spectroscopy get this from photons. Emission and luminescence use thermal, radiant (photon) or chemical energy
<br>Continuum source - Emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths
<br>Line source - Emits radiation only at select wavelengths
<br>Flame and plasma sources are used for thermal energy
<br>Chemical energy is provided by exothermic or chemiluminescent reactions
<br>In a continuum source, nominal wavelength is the wavelength which the wavelength selector is set to pass (its not exactly that, since its continuum)
<br>Effective bandwidth - the width of the band of radiation passing through a wavelength selector measured at half the bands height
<br>Resolution - separation between two spectral features, narrow effective bandwidth increases resolution
<br>FIlters narrow the bandwidth

 <br>
Difficult but rewarding
<br>While we can describe reactors as ideal plug flow, ideal backmix or ideal batch reactors, in reality, none of the reactors at large scale follow these equations well. This is due to short circuiting and recycling of fluid<br><br>
Great idea in general but how does an RTD have anything to do with non ideal flows in reactors???
<br>
<br>, theta is simply the dimensionless time in terms of spacetime of the reactor
<br>The internal age distribution of the contents of the reactor is denoted by I
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240621004336.png" src="pasted-image-20240621004336.png">
<br>Exit age distribution is a distribution of residence times of fluid in the reactor
<br><br>
<br>These are all done using stimulus response techniques, where we add a stimulus in the reactor and see how the system responds to it
<br><br>
<br>When a step tracer is added to the reactor
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240621202105.png" src="pasted-image-20240621202105.png">
<br>It slowly increases from 0 to one


<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20240621202300.png" src="pasted-image-20240621202300.png"><br>
<br>This happens when a pulse input is added. It forms a "C" shaped curve
<br>
<br>To get the conversion, simply get the conversion as a function for spacetime and integrate it over the distribution
<br><br>
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240621225105.png" src="pasted-image-20240621225105.png">
<br>This is for packed bed and tubular reactors (plug flow basically)
<br>The idea here is that there is diffusive mass transfer that occurs between any slice of fluid in the plug flow and the rest of the fluid axially in front and behind it
<br>Fick's law of diffusion:
<br>Peclet number measures the intensity of dispersion, with it being 0 for ideal plug flow and infinity for ideal backmix  
<br>The C or F curve can be converted to a theoretical curve by fitting to the data and the relationship between standard deviation, mean of  and D/uL is given by a set of equations found by Levenspiel the greatest human himself around page 266 of his stellar book, Chemical Reaction Engineering
<br>This kind of data analysis to get peclet number is usually done using a pulse tracer input. A pulse input manytimes causes flow disturbances at it's point of entry and to correct for this, readings are taken at two downstream points and the delta of the two points is taken for standard deviations and all
<br>The formulae for getting the peclet number from these deltas are also given in levenspiel
<br>When they give bed porosity and such, its to calculate the space time of the reactor so we can get the dimensionless units which are used to get peclet number and all
<br>The first part is accounting for bulk flow, The second for diffusive mass transfer and third for reactive dissapearance<img alt="Pasted image 20240621235412.png" src="pasted-image-20240621235412.png"><img alt="Pasted image 20240621235423.png" src="pasted-image-20240621235423.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240621235442.png" src="pasted-image-20240621235442.png">
<br>These three equations are the same and are used to find conversions for a dispersed plug flow reactor
<br><br>
It is time to congratulate ourselves as we have survived the first wave of a non ideal world<br>
pat yourself on the back. * pats * 
<br>
<br>If we hit ourselves in a head a bit hard, really batter the skull, we realize that the dispersion model is actually really hard and we can easily model some amount of axial mixing using a number of backmix reactors.
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240622173336.png" src="pasted-image-20240622173336.png">
<br>The above are the equations for number of backmix reactors, j
<br><br>
<br>When either model isnt enough to describe a reactor, a model made up of many different kinds of flow patterns is called a mixed model
<br>there are plug flow regions, dispersed plug flow regions, backmix regions, deadwater regions
<br>Bypass flow - when a portion of liquid bypasses the vessel or a particular flow region
<br>Recycle flow - when a portion of fluid leaving a flow region is recycled back into in
<br>Cross flow - when there is exchange between flow regions but no net transfer of liquid
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240622184349.png" src="pasted-image-20240622184349.png">
<br>The above is what the mean theta should look like if there is no deadwater region

This subject is actually pretty cool
<br>
<br>Safety - its the use of technologies to prevent disasters before they occur
<br>Hazard - a chemical or physical condition that has the potential to cause damage
<br>Risk - A measure of human injury, environmental damage or economic loss in terms of both incident likelihood and magnitude of loss or injury
<br>Engineering ethics - with the given resources, engineers must make a safe and secure working environment. This is a responsibility to society
<br><br>
<br>Important statistics in weighing the merits and demerits of different safety systems:
<br>OSHA incidence rate - number of worker injuries per 100 worker years. One worker year is assumed to contain 2000 worker hours. 
<br>OSHA incidence rate can also be on the basis of lost workdays
<br>Fatality rate (per year)
<br>Fatal Accident Rate - Used by the british chemical industry, number of fatalities per 1000 employees working a full lifetime, so FAR is 10^8 worker hours 
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104221251.png" src="pasted-image-20241104221251.png">
<br>Accident stats can be misleading as major causes of death like the bhopal incident are in one single event
<br>Acceptable levels of risk, for any procedure - if the plant has more than one procedure (always...), the levels of risk must be much much less than the levels for normally sitting at home, since the risks of exposure form multiple processes can be additive
<br><br>
Chemical Accidents follow typical patterns
<br>
<br>Mostly comprise of fires, explosions and vapour cloud explosions. Also a little bit of windstorms and flooding
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104221929.png" src="pasted-image-20241104221929.png">
<br>Explosions cause a lot of economic loss. Vapour cloud explosions occur when a large cloud of volatile and flammable vapour is released unconfined in the whole plant, then ignited
<br>Toxic release causes little capital loss, however, lots of lawsuits and deaths
<br>Almost all accidents not caused by natural disaster can be attributed to human error or mechanical error. Other causes can be process upsets, design or sabotage
<br>piping systems, storage tanks followed by reactor piping systems are the biggest locations of accidents
<br>Accidents follow a three step process: initiation, propagation and termination
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104223410.png" src="pasted-image-20241104223410.png">
<br><br>
<br>An inherently safe plant relies on process chemistry and physics rather than  control systems, interlocks, redundancy and all to stop accidents
<br>layers of safety above the process are of no interest to inherent design (they are needed, but inherent design focuses mostly on the first layer, which is the process itself)
<br>Inherent design is described using four words - minimize(intensification), substitute, moderate(attenuation and limitation of effects) and simplify(simplification and error tolerances)
<br>minimize - reduce storage and usage of hazardous chemicals in process, if possible, they should be produced and consumed in situ
<br>substitute - use different materials in the process
<br>moderate - use the hazardous materials in less hazardous conditions, such as refrigerated, in low vapour pressure, using larger particle sizes to reduce dust issues (flash explosions)
<br>simplify - make the plant simpler by : designing controls to be placed in a friendly, logical manner, separating processes to prevent domino effect, etc
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104224546.png" src="pasted-image-20241104224546.png">
<br>Just read the above, no need to memorize
<br><br><br>
<br>Nypro limited produced 70,000 tonnes a year of caprolactam, used in production of nylon
<br>Process used cyclohexane, which volatilizes immediately in atmospheric conditions
<br>six reactors in series oxidising cyclohexane to cyclohexanol using inhected air in the presence of a catalyst. Each reactor containing 20 tonnes of cyclohexane
<br>reactor 5 had a leak - a vertical crack in it's stainless steel structure. They removed the reactor for repairs. They then connected reactor 4 to reactor 6
<br>Actual pipes were 28 inches in diameter, they only had 20 inches. They made a workaround and created a bypass. 
<br>Bypass didnt have enough support, overflexed, and ruptured
<br>30 tons of cyclohexane were freed, forming a vapour cloud, which was then ignited, levelling the entire facility and killed a number of people
<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Bhopal Accident" href="bhopal-accident.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bhopal Accident</a>
<br><br>
<br>Explosion occurred at the wastewater tank at the ARCO chemical plant in channelview, texas
<br>Oxygen analyser didnt detect flammable atmosphere in the tank, (due to buildup of peroxides), the flammable vapours got sucked into the compressor when it restarted and ignited
<br>this happened during maintenance 
<br>proper MOC procedures should have been followed before maintenance work
<br><br>
<br>Ammonium nitrate explosion, port neal iowa
<br>Process shut down, AN was left in vessels
<br>The nitric acid plant was shut down, to prevent backflow of AN into the nitric acid line, 200 psig steam was applied through a nitric acid sparger.
<br>AN is more sensitive to decomposition at higher temperatures, other plants were stricter about steam sparges
<br>Process safety knowledge is the RBPS element causing this
<br>There should have been a HAZOP study, so another element could be "Process Knowledge Management" and "HAZOP"
<br><br>
<br>Tank of crude oil that had been emptied had to be connected via pipe to another tank
<br>Workers from outside came to weld, welding caused ignition of flammable vapours
<br>Welder was the only one out of 4 wearing a harness, so he was injured while the others died
<br>Contractor management is the RBPS element here
<br><br>
<br>Explosion and fire killed five workers
<br>PVC stored began burning
<br>Vinyl chloride monomer along with other components are heated under pressure to make PVC
<br>Worker confused which reactor was in operation and which wasn't because of plant layout
<br>Worker overrode the interlock system to drain the reactor as he thought it was faulty
<br>VCM poured out, building filled with vapour and liquid
<br>Shift foreman took measures to slow  release rather than evacuate
<br>Operating procedures needed
<br><br>
<br>Plant converted scrap metal to powders
<br>Powders werent cleaned periodically
<br>Portions of dust ignited several times, causing flash fires in the air

 Great at pipes, OK at water tanks, bathware
<br>Important
One of the small companies to get big because of the transition from GI to plastic pipes
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240813081657.png" src="pasted-image-20240813081657.png"><br><br>
<br>These guys started in 1998, Santej Gujarat. They made CPVC pipes after licensing from some US company
<br>They started uPVC manufacture from 2004 for water pipes. The first lead free kind
<br>Dholka plant made to manufacture more pipes and other stuff like solvent cement
<br>2013 they began a plant in the south to gain market control there
<br>2015 silencio piping (quiet pipes)
<br>2020 forth they became a more general company, manufacturing water tanks as well
Tldr
They licensed tech from goodrich to make pipes right when the GI transition was occuring, once that started, they licensed more stuff from goodrich on adhesives and all. They've entered the water tank business now, but I'm clueless as to what trend thats following, same with paints


<br><br>(businessii?)<br><br>
<br>CPVC pro - a proprietary CPVC formulation. Used in buildings to transport water, drinking grade. Rugged, small thermal coefficients
<br>Pex A pro - uses cross linked polyethylene for strength and flexibility (stronger than a plastic bag, weaker than a CPVC pipe), drinking grade, non toxic, used in awkward piping solutions, <a data-href="Supreme Industries" href="supreme-industries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supreme Industries</a> doesn't have this
<br>Foamcore solution - Better load distribution, lighter weight, strong. Made up of two rigid layers with foam in between.
<br>multipex - crosslined PE, with aluminium middle layer. Good flexibility and strength, frost resistance, etc. 3 layers. Possibly a unique product
<br>PVC underground pipes, cheap, non drinking grade for sewage
<br>aquarius, eco pro - first is for drinking water using lead free uPVC and second for reclaimed water
<br>Silencio for low noise application
<br>Drain pro - 3 layer drain pipe for strength. PP is mineral filled apparently. Fittings have a depth gauge
<br>manhole inspection chambers and lids
<br>Their cross linked polyethylene seems unique
<br><br>Sell polymer based adhesives for maintenance, woodcare, leakage, seapage, cracks solution, waterproofing adhesives (only found these guys selling this...), admixtures, mortars for tile and levelling<br>
gap filling adhesives (work on expansion joints as well), tapes, plumbing specific formulations for sealing and cementing, sealants, putties for use in cars, for product application<br><br>I don't want to know about this, they are a small player compared to asian paints and the lot, anyways this industry is going to be pushed out by the incoming storm<br><br>
<br>Same as <a data-href="Supreme Industries" href="supreme-industries.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supreme Industries</a>

<br>Very few real world applications of this - mostly because of the termination by rearrangement issue and chain transfer. Recently they've been solved somewhat
<br><br>
<br>The initiators are almost always of R+A- type since R+ is an electrophile and in cationic polymerization, we are trying to take away the electron from the monomer. This R+A- can be generated using sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, lewis acids:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240914231947.png" src="pasted-image-20240914231947.png">
<br>The second step of initiation involves:<img alt="Pasted image 20240914232104.png" src="pasted-image-20240914232104.png">
<br><br>
<br>It's the same as the second step really. Do I really need to cover it again?
<br><br>
<br>This be juicy because, on the one hand, it cannot combine as the ions repel each other, but that doesnt rule out some kind of disproportionation (forgive me if I don't get the word usage right, we really weren't taught the idea behind naming in the book). 
<br>Rearrangement termination:<img alt="Pasted image 20240914232616.png" src="pasted-image-20240914232616.png">
<br>Chain transfer to monomer(the chain can get transferred to pretty much anything, polymer, solvent, however chain transfer to polymer doesn't affect the final degree of polymerization so it's all chill):<img alt="Pasted image 20240914233024.png" src="pasted-image-20240914233024.png">
<br>If you think about it, even unimolecular is just chain transfer to counter ion, it's just that the chain doesn't really continue after that so it's all for nothing
<br>The above note is probably great for people like me, who like to classify everything they learn and make connections to make the world seem awesome when really it's all just chaotic and nothing makes any sense really most of all what our goal is as a species and that feeling of loneliness you get when you're up at 11:30pm, 2 hours past your bedtime on a saturday night writing polymer notes thinking, "maybe that girl who looked at me during the CS boards liked me and I should have asked her out after the exam...". You know the worst part about all this? I don't even have this as a subject. I started studying it and now I just can't stop. I really hope this isn't just a gigantic waste of time and that it will come to use somewhere in my life. I really hope so. Boy will I feel so cheated by the world if it doesnt :/ Thats how I know I'll never use it for anything ever and the time im spending on it right now would be better spent watching a movie. I hate life. If I found life I'd... I'd do some horrible things to it as revenge for all of us having to face it. Really amazing piece of work, this dreadful existence is.
<br>OK, now on to za kineticzz analysis

WHY IS THERE NO TERM FOR EFFICIENCY OF INITIATION IN IONIZATION POLYMERIZATION? IS IT PERFECT? IS IT? WHAT DOES IT THINK OF ITSELF? THAT IT'S BETTER THAN RADICAL POLYMERIZATION?

Faq
A really great question that comes a lot from my friend, who shall be unnamed, is on why so many equations are like this - derivative of log of something with respect to something else and the other side just NEEDS to then have the variable with respect to raised to the negative second power. He sent me a reddit link on this as well
Here's my take on it - some quantities, we don't know or want to know parameters like the arrhenius collision parameter here - who on earth wants to go through the pain of finding those out accurately? not me definitely not me. So, instead, we want to get out answer as a ratio of the rate or degree that it was before, so we can just multiply it with the initial value and get the new value. It's less of a mathematical need in my mind and more of a luxury for engineers and scientists really. We could very well go ahead and work out all the arrhenius parameters and completely miss the need for any of this but we like stuff easy
I could be wrong. Don't kill me

These micelles contain a hydrophobic core, which can absorb a good amount of water insoluble substances<br>When monomer is added, 3 phases develop - aqueous phase with small amounts of monomer and surfactant, large droplets containing lots of monomer and surfactant, small droplets (very very common) containing some monomer and surfactant around <br><br><br>This is the stage where particles are formed. What are particles? The book doesn't say - I guess they are drops but polymer. Particle nucleation occurs through three methods:<br>
<br>Micellular Nucleation - Micelle receives oligomeric radical formed from initiator and monomer in aqueous phase. Micelle keeps growing and attracting more monomer until no more micelles left without radical.
<br>Homogeneous nucleation - chain radical formed, attracted surfactant for colloidal stability and monomers for propagation. Ends when these particles get big enough to attract even oligomeric radicals
<br>Coagulation nucleation - A bunch of oligomeric radicals clump up together until the molecule is big enough to achieve colloidal stability itself and then starts absorbing monomer and propagates<br>
Micellular nucleation happens when the solution is well above CMC, homogeneous is when surfactant is little and coagulation is when surfactant is even less
<br><br>in the first part of particle growth (AKA interval 2), monomers are provided by monomer droplets to the particles, to keep them propagating. When all the monomer droplets are used up, we enter interval 3, when rate of polymerization continuously decreases<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20240913212427.png" src="pasted-image-20240913212427.png"><br>
Taking Smith Ewart's Case 2, each particle can be assumed to have only one radical at a time and when another enters, the two react extremely fast to terminate. This way, each particle has, on average one radical, half the time:<br>

What? how is this different from regular emulsion polymerization? weirdddd

Suppose we have a reaction forming ammonia from Nitrogen and hydrogen. This reaction is reversible and has an equilibrium. We want to make a function that's at a maximum when equilibrium is achieved<br>

This will be tricky
<br><br>
<br>On a solid fluid boundary, fluid layers adjacent to the solid move with the same velocity as the solid - This is the no slip condition
<br>For liquid gas interface, the shear stress is negligible. 
<br>For liquid liquid interface, the shear stress is continuous over the interface. The momentum flux is perpendicular to the interface
<br><br>
<br>Equation of continuity is mass rate balance and equation of motion is a momentum rate balance

Try and understand the equation of motion


<br>The diagram, while I cannot draw right now, is very similar to the equation of continuity
<br>the things moving through are the momenum fluxes
<br>There are two types of stresses, conductive (viscous) stress and convective stress
<br>Equation of motion is developed by writing a momentum balance over a volume element fixed in space, through which a fluid is flowing
<br>
<br>x component is developed as follows, convective and molecular transport (conductive)
<br>Rate at which x momentum enters and leaves the faces at x and x+ are (convective)
<br>Rate at which x momentum enters and leaves the faces at Y and Y+ are (Conductive)
<br>Rate at which x momentum enters and leaves the faces at Z and Z+ are (Conductive)
<br>Addition of the above 3 components gives the net rate of addition of x momentum. 
<br><br><br>
<br>Rate at which Y momentum enters and leaves the faces at x and x+ are (convective)
<br>Rate at which Y momentum enters and leaves the faces at Y and Y+ are (Conductive)
<br>Rate at which Y momentum enters and leaves the faces at Z and Z+ are (Conductive)
<br><br>you know how to do this<br><br>
<br>Net rate of addition of X-momentum is:
<br>
<br>In addition there is an external force (typically the gravitation) acting on the fluid in volume element. X component of this force is (mass * g_x basically lol). The g_x is the g in the x direction, which is 0 na lmao 
<br>Total of the above 4 terms gives x-component only, and should be equal to the rate of accumulation of x-momentum within the volume element
<br>
<br>This gives: 
<br>dividing both sides by the control volume:
<br>
<br>similarly can be written for y and z elements
<br>phi actually contains both convective and molecular transport elements
<br>
<br>

Equation of motion should actually be called equation of momentum/force. It has convective forces, conductive forces and external forces (pressure and gravity)


<br><br>
<br>It's stress. Very difficult to explain without a diagram, but I forgot the graphics tablet in my room. 
<br>IN 2D:
<br>Tau yx is the viscosity multiplied by the gradient of x velocity with respect to y
<br>Tau zx is the viscosity multiplied by the gradient of x velocity with respect to z
<br>Tau xx is the viscosity multiplied by the gradient of x velocity with respect to x
<br>Tau xx, Tau yy, Tau zz are all direct stresses due to viscosity
<br>IN 3D:
<br>
<br>what a nightmare to visualize... 
<br>analogously (?) you can get this for all the other components - yz,xz
<br>
<br>analogously (?) you can get the tau for all other components - yy,xx
<br>expand the convective stresses if you want using the product rule

The trickiest thing about polymerization isn't initiation or propagation but termination
<br>
<br>wood is a composite of cellulose and lignin - polyphenolic compound. Lignin binds the cellulose
<br><br>
<br>Emulsion polymerization - used where two phases are immiscible, polymer formed is in a single phase. The substance used to bind the phases is called an emulsifier. Emulsifiers are used to match the surface energy of the two phases. Acrylic emulsions are in pharma, paints and cosmetics.
<br>Solution polymerization -  
<br>Suspension polymerization
<br>Bulk polymerization
<br><br>
<br>The most basic requirement of polymerization is that each monomer must have a functionality greater than 2
<br>Functionality is the number of bonds it can make with other functional groups of other monomers
<br>Carothers classified polymerization reactions into addition polymerization and condensation polymerization. This classification isn't in use anymore as there was some overlap between the two
<br>The method of classifying polymerization reactions is in <a data-href="step growth" href="step-growth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">step growth</a> and <a data-href="chain growth" href="chain-growth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">chain growth</a> polymerizations
<br>Step growth polymerizations are characterized by a high rate of reaction at the start, levelling out later. For these polymerizations, high extent of reactions (of the functional groups) are required for high chain lengths
<br>Chain growth polymerizations have a constant rate of reaction from start to end

Polymers don't have a boiling point because of how large their molecular mass is and because they degrade before they can boil

<br>
<br>Since we know, from experiment, that the equilibrium of a single component single phase system is controlled by only two state variables, we can express any other variable as the function of these two variables in the following manner:
<br>
<br>This is like taking a substance from one state to the other by keeping one variable constant, then changing the other, then doing the other way round
<br>
<br>This can be better understood from linear algebra, when there are two independent variables and a bunch of dependent variables. A thermodynamic system is the same. We can look at it like a vector space
<br>
<br>For open systems, a sizing parameter like number of moles can also be added to the mix
<br>
<br>An interesting nature of the partial derivatives shown above is that they depend on the path you take. dU/dT at constant volume is not the same as taking it at constant pressure. This is because moving it along the constant pressure line will give a different value as well, making the total the same. Also the final state itself is different if you just change the temperature at constant pressure vs constant volume, so you're really comparing apples to oranges
<br>
Important
A few important things:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241104110814.png" src="pasted-image-20241104110814.png">

<br>Similar to what I said above, <img alt="Pasted image 20241104112848.png" src="pasted-image-20241104112848.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104112905.png" src="pasted-image-20241104112905.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104112919.png" src="pasted-image-20241104112919.png">
<br>This is the triple product rule, If X increases with Y (holding Z constant), and Z increases with X (holding Y constant), then Y must decrease with Z (holding X constant) to keep the overall relationship consistent
<br>This also shows how he movement of x is dependent on the movements of y and z



<br>We need a section for <a data-href="Vector Calculus" href="vector-calculus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vector Calculus</a><br><br>
<br>We need to express variables like entropy and internal energy in terms of variables we can measure, such as pressure or temperature. To do this, we use the maxwell relations
<br>we shall try and get to them
<br>for open systems: 
<br>
<br>
<br>from these two, a list of more relations can be derived. They aren't really derived as much as they are identified:
<br>If we know the equation for any differential variable in the system expressed in two other variables, the components multiplied on it, will be equal to the partial derivative of the variable with respect to the independent variable keeping the other independent variable constant
<br>These are not as difficult as I initially thought...
<br>These aren't maxwell relations though, those are slightly more:
<br>So in general, to get those, you differentiate the identities above by the other independent variable, for both independent variables, and those are equal to each other
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241104153905.png" src="pasted-image-20241104153905.png">
<br><a data-href="EOS" href="eos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">EOS</a> and the preceeding notecovers equation of state pretty well. There's peng robinson, van der waals. You could look at the algebraic manipulations to get to the roots and all but honestly, its not worth it. 
<br><br>
<br>This got me somewhat confused in class
<br>So basically, we got reduced pressure, reduced temperature and reduced volume - P/P_c, T/T_c, V/V_c, where c means critical point.
<br>The principle of corresponding states says that any van der waals fluid (not any fluid), that has the same reduced pressure and reduced temperature will have the same reduced volume and is thus in a corresponding state. Why they couldn't just define Tc, Pc in each equation and leave pressure and temperature alone is beyond me... Maybe they just wanted to be elegant
<br>Accentric factor is used in some equations of states to account for non sphericity
<br><br>
<br>The first assumption confirms that I should be an engineer because I knew it before even reading about it :lol:
<br>Each functional group contributes the same properties regardless of presence of other functional groups or structure of molecules.
<br>The above is almost never true in real life (or ideally for that matter)
<br>This assumption could be improved to include effects of first or second level neighbours, I'm pretty sure I could come up with something to fit.

<br>This seems like an odd topic to make a note on, but it's really important to understand
<br>Temperature is that quantity that is the same in two substances (regardless of what they are) when they are in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is when there is not heat flow between them.
<br>This definition of temperature leads to all sorts of temperature scales but two things really narrow down the choices:
<br>One  - the scale should cause temperature to increase with the degree of "hotness"
<br>Two - the ratio of energy flow out to entropy change  is equal to temperature. This concept will be better understood after reading <a data-href="entropy" href="entropy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">entropy</a>
<br>From here we can define heat - the energy flow from a system due to temperature difference is heat. This, I expect, will anger any sane reader - how can temperature and heat have such self referencing definitions (is that the right term?). To that I'll join you. The scientists have really done some weird stuff
<br>Work is the other component of energy flow, which is characterised by mechanical motion between system boundaries
<br>heat and work are really fundamentally different in the sense, that all of work can be converted into heat energy, but the reverse is not possible
<br>The above gets infinitely more confusing when we get to entropy, so enjoy
<br>That's all I'll write on temperature as of now

 <br>Yesterday we have discussed various examples that comprise FTIR. There is small confusion within this scissoring. Only to this stretching and assymetric stretching belong to stretching vibration  and the rest are bending vibrations. Is this clear?<br>
Now coming to the molecule, we have seen (bunch of stuff)... if you remember that. We have also seen the effect of conjugation on frequency and lone pairs on frequency. I'll put the question now in class assessment. You can solve that<br>Still assessment 4 and 5 are incomplete. If you complete assessment 5 , then I'll think to put this, otherwise it'll be homework ...  it's up to you. Coming to this ... what happened? done. Mark your attendance<br>
Yesterday i told you, therell be a quizz competition among yourselves, based on yesterdays lecture. So where we can use? we can identify the organic and inorganic compounds, polymer, polymer blends, additive coatings, pharma, surface... various liquids, various dyes we can take. This IR is very useful in every sector. The thing is that, if you're talking that... that element's lattice parameters you can measure using IR, this is because of the wavelength of IR being smaller than those. We have also seen the alkene, alkyne, various types of bonds... frequency. All these are very important, this may be happen since we are scrolling down our books. So what happen above this point? widely used in each and every sector. Therefore, one should think that in case of biochemistry also, biomolecule.<br>
Coming to the biomolecule, these are part of our body and can be analysed using IR. I told you, one cannot identify the stucture using one spectroscopy, you need to couple them. I will also now show you some medicinal plants. This is a medicinal plant -name-. We extract the active ingredient. Similarly this one, anticancerous drug. Various medicinal values. One can refer this journal, take a snapshot and circulate among your colleagues. Yeah, so, as I said. I just have to show you the difference between aliphatic and aromatic again Just observing the difference in the spectra, in the fingerprint region, you can see some shear stretching there and C-C single bond vibration there. Why aromatic compound higher frequency? or lower? If you have aromatic structure, these vibration are fixed, whereas alkane, you wont see such kind of bands in this region. You wont find the examples in david harvey and such books. The examples are taken from various researchers and papers. This is heptane, how many carbon? 7, this is toluene, how many carbon? 7. Same carbon numbers but different environment. One is saturated, the other is unsaturated. So difference in hybridisation. SP2 is more electronegative character and SP3 is less, so high energy needed to vibrate the bond. So, one can see that you observe the alkane, below 3000/cm. But if you talk about alkene or toluene, is ... So my second question, based on this concept, what is the effect on styrene, will frequency increase or decrease? Why frequency decrease? because bond length increase. Are you getting this aliphatic and aromatic concept? -sir explains it again- small bond = big frequency<br>
Maximum number of bond, stronger the bond. Directly proportional (on energy and frequency).<br>
If you're talking about energy, in this case, one can measure the frequency in terms of wavenumber. In case of IR, we express frequency in terms of wavenumber. Ok very good. Uhh yeah, someone enjoy my teaching, very good. -sir draws an solution to watve's question-<br>
Just for sake of understanding, consider carbon carbon single bond. There are two derivatives (&gt;?)... so when you have iodine, when you think about carbon carbon single bond for the same molecule =, what will happen? it will donate the electron. Yesterday we spoke about the +I effect. The more the effect, the larger the size, the smaller the size. So this bond length is comparable to the size of fluorine. You can take carbon carbon single bond or carbon carbon single bond, here the bond length is lower compared to carbon carbon single bond. Clear? If smaller, more energy is needed to stretch or bend. Thus more frequency is required. Similarly in case of alkyne, even worse. So the S orbital or that cabron atom, very close to the nucleus, therefore difficult to excite electron to higher energy levels. Clear? Based on this we have a small, I could say, yes. Can you differentiate the structure? Here, most of the more than 3000 or more than 3000. Actually, I had given the animation here, not working for this slide. In exam, you will get the frequency and guess the structure. Tentatively we'll take the example, tentatively. Nahi samjha? If possible, if you write the whole structure of the molecule, what about this? this corresponds to what? what stretching or bending? what about this? this is a C-H, stretching. Then, wait I'll just remove that, I'm not sure why that happened, I have tried it. Yeah. Now it's visible? yeah, please pay your attention here - carbon oxygen stretching here, single bond. Yeah, one can see that. Remember that if you take the alcohol, you can get the peak, a band, from 3400 to 3622 cm-1, in case of OH stretching vibrations. In case of carboxylic acid, there are two functional groups attatched. We have seen that yesterday, CO and OH. So you OH and C=0 vibrations are mixing and you'll get the sharp peaks together. So here, you can see that, this is the hydrocarbon, you can see the peaks for vibrations for the C-H and C-C bond. Again the same, I'll draw this, remove this. Yeah, yes. So we can see that here, we can get C-H vibrations here. So as I said, for carboxylic acid, we can get the vibrations together. So this is for simple... we have seen carbonyl group right? so carbonyl group also present in aldehyde, ketone, amide, what else? various molecules such as the double bond and we can see the carbon sulfur double bond and what else? remember that if you're talking about carbon double bond frequency, it is in this range, starting from 1600 to 1800. That frequency, in case of aldehyde shows higher frequency to ketone due to electronegative effect. But if you take ester or carboxylic acid, it has a lower frequency, remember this carbon is very hungry of electron, so that is why you can see that... Ha, boliye (dev says something) Here there is no inverval for hydrogen bonding. In the next slide we have an interval for hydrogen bonding. Here you can see that there is no carbon frequency here. It's a simple alcohol. Hope you have understood this part.<br>
So can you tell me which vibrations require higher frequency? stretching ... clear about this?<br>
What are the types of vibrations we have seen which are responsible for the IR band?<br>
Your good name? Munish, good. SO, we are talking about IR frequency, the two important vibrations are stretching and bending. If you're talking about stretching, there are two types of stretching and for bending, there are 4 types of bending... RIght? So this is the last slide of FTIR, if you havent understood any concept, please let me know. These are the references for your better understanding. MOstly the IR soectroscopy is used for qualitative analysis. Yeah, yeah - good question. Yeah, why stretching require higher energy? can anyone explain? I have already explained. It's ok you asked a question, I'll give an answer. Bending is very easy, stretching is harder. Oxygen lone pair gets donated. This one is the minus and that one is the plus. Clear? Clear? Because of resonance, bond length is increased. Kulkarni, if you have any queries, I'll be happy to answer. The last subtopics of this theory, of this, not course. So the last topic is electrochemistry or a=electroanalytics. We discussed the examples... can you name that? firefly, jellyfish,<br>
Why we observe the fluoroscence? WHy any species show that fluoroscence? any answer? higher state to lower. Are you sure, that when the electron come from the state to ground state, they give light? I will explain in the coming slides, but what are your? and in the night  it shows the fluoroscence. Toh maine clarify kiya tha voh.<br>
How many of you are using the cycle? you are using that jacket or that helmet, it luminesces<br>
First the excitation and emission. Hogaya aapka discussion? if you allow me, I'll speak. If you speak of photolumiescence, its because of electron from higher state to lower state. What absorption happens, it absorbs energy from ground state to higher state. It emit the energy as a lumiscent photon. Not all relaxation shows luminescence or fluoroscence. Got the point? No? it emits the radiance as photon. If every molecule shows fluoroscence, we are all fluoroscent. If you go in sunlight, again more energy, very intense high energy photon striking on our body. Thats why we feel very hot, right? This is the absorption spectra and this is the fluoroscence spectra. This is absorbed at higher wavelength, lower energy. This is for the absorption and this is for the emission. So, first we'll discuss about the luminescence. So, am I audible? If you;re talking about luminescence, it's resulting from the excitation of the electron. But the excitation is not because of heating. Here relaxation is due to the cold body, normal temperature. It could be caused by the... because of all this phenomena, when it comes down, it releases energy as fluoroscence. When it comes down, we can see the fluoroscence]]></description><link>transcript.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Transcript.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 06:00:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vapour Liquid Equilibrium]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:thermo" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#thermo</a>

<br>Some random rule relating fugacity of a component of a mixture to it's actual fugacity
<br>This is only applicable to ideal mixtures
<br>
<br>For real mixtures:
<br>
<br>gamma is the activity coefficient
<br>gamma * y_i is the activity<br>
Now we doeth problems
<br><br>In more than two phases, we have like, lets say c components, so c-1 independent variables (the mole fractions, say) per phase. On top of that T and P are independent variables for single phase so:<br>
total number of independent variables - P(c-1)+2, where P is the number of phases<br>
And number of equilibrium relationships is (P-1)c<br><br>
<br>
<br>This gives degrees of freedom
<br>So like on the saturated lines, with two phases, for a single component, you have 1 degree of freedom and for single phase,single component, you have 2 degrees of freedom as mentioned before in thermodynamics.THIS IS HOW IT CAME ABOUT. Big epik

After the end semester, it's OK to forget everything in this class.<br>
The only things to remember are the following<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241010114229.png" src="pasted-image-20241010114229.png">


<br>Danger
DONT FORGET EVERYTHING BEFORE EXAM THOUGH. Unless you have a girlfriend. Then toh life sort
<br><br>
<br>Many times we have a mixture where the two components are very differing in BP, typically in the petrochemical industry. So you need to separate a low BP, highly volatile component from one with a higher BP, higher molecular mass. If we assume ideal mixture, then relative volatility is the ratio of p1sat to p2sat. So if your boiling points of two components are close to each other, then relative volatility will be small. Also relative volatility cant be less than 1, because p1 will always be the more volatile component.

<br><br>At different conversions, the diffusive properties of the chains differ (lol). This is important because these diffusive properties, control how molecules meet each other and react. Thus if they are low enough in any area they can cause certain parts of the radical polymerization mechanism to go slower or faster. Certain parts can be "diffusion controlled"<br>Types of diffusion<br>
<br>Segmental Diffusion - Refers to orientation of molecules reacting. Propagation and termination are controlled by this at low conversions since they molecules have to be in correct orientation to react and translational diffusion when the chain is small is good
<br>Translational Diffusion - Refers to actual diffusion (the centre of mass moves). Controls the termination step at high conversions. An interesting effect, known as autoacceleration or the Trommsdorf-Norrish effect occurs when reaction mixtures become translational diffusion controlled - the termination step decreases and since propagation is not affected by translational diffusion (monomers still diffuse about easily), the conversion increases and the termination step decreases more, so on and so on. The reaction mixture becomes really viscous and even glass like (vitrifies)
<br>Reactive diffusion - everything slow, chains move only by adding new monomers

<br><br>Chain polymerizations where termination reactions are very very small in number are called living polymerizations as they dont get dead chains.<br>
We come real close to that in Radical polymerization using two separate techniques - rapid capping and uncapping of active sites and exchange of caps between radical chains to prevent their reactions and thus termination<br><br>This is an application of the first technique using nitroxide to cap and uncap active sites real quick. This suffers from issues such as side reactions causing disproportionation in the chain radical with nitroxide<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240913220702.png" src="pasted-image-20240913220702.png"><br>
You also got stuff like TEMPO, TIPNO and SG1, which are better than nitroxide in many ways<br>

<br>I'll write this part on a reread

Section for stuff I don't understand and maybe reddit questions I end up posting
<br>
<br>Other than rapid end capping and uncapping, how can termination be reduced? I don't suppose they use reversible deactivation radical polymerization in industry - so how do they control degree of polymerization?
<br>In emulsion polymerization are the monomers soluble in water? If not, then how are small quantities of monomer dissolved in the aqueous phase?How is micellar nucleation even possible?

I'm guessing the propagation and initiation and thus termination also includes a chain formed from the non side of styrene having the radical so this above reaction scheme is not complete and also I'm not sure what I have here is a reaction scheme - what is a reaction scheme??<br>

Better than solution polymerization. This requires the monomer and initiator to be insoluble in the solvent. The monomer and initiator are added, a suspension(whats the difference between a suspension and an emulsion?) is created, this is agitated at high speeds to create small droplets in which the polymerization reactions are taken into completion. After its complete, the polymer is filtered or centrifuged out. Dispersion stabilizers are also used (what are dispersion stabilizers? How do they work?)<br>This is great because the heat transfer surface is amazing, viscosity doesn't matter too much, widely used in industry.<br>According to sir, the only process that gives beads (not powder, much more than 10 micrometer), is suspension.

 <br>The sales or revenue is also called the top line of a company<br>Important
Accounting merely means recounting; and this process involves recording, classifying and summarizing of past events and transactions of financial nature with a view to enabling the user of accounts to interpret the resulting summary
<br>Quote
“This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.” — Douglas Adams
<br><br>
<br>Inflow - Income (money coming in that isn't repayable), Debt/Liabilities (money coming in that is repayable), Selling Asset
<br>Outflow - Expense (Something you're spending money on that you are getting the rewards of instantly, you don't get the money back), Assets (Something you're spending money on that you will get rewards of in long term and you get the money back - recoverable, whatever a firm holds and uses for a long period), Clearing Liability
<br>Classification of transactions happens in these 6 areas ^
<br>Income - Not repayable inflow
<br>Liability - Repayable inflow
<br>Expense - Not recoverable outflow
<br>Assets  - Recoverable in the future
<br>Profit and loss is , P&amp;L account deals with revenue
<br>Balance sheet is in liabilities and assets, BL sheet deals with capital
<br>To account for asset usage, depreciation cost is kept in expenses
<br>Depreciation is a non cash expense
<br><br>
<br>Tangible - Land, plant, machinery, etc.
<br>Intangible - Goodwill, etc.
<br>Whatever is payable is a liability, whatever is receivable is an asset
<br>Whatever you use for a long period of time is also an asset
<br><br>
<br>You buy a machine and depreciate it to 0 over 5 years in the machinery account, when you sell it, you log it as: income
<br>If the machine breaks down before depreciation makes it 0, you file the rest as expense
<br><br>
<br>Is an earning as a result of normal business activity or otherwise. It is also called sales turnover
<br>Whatever is from the main core of the business is operating income
<br><br>
<br>An expense is an outflow of money in return for a product or service. It is also known as cost
<br><br>
<br>An asset is a resource which has economic usefulness in business operations over several years
<br><br>
<br>A liability is an obligation owed by the business to any external stakeholder<br>
Every transaction has atleast 2 effects in 1 or more of these 4 buckets<br>
HW - ask about the number of accounts<br>
HW - How many accounts would I have?
<br><br><br>business owner and business are separate entities<br>
<br>the profits minus dividends are shown as a liability to the owner
<br><br>
<br>each company is an ongoing operation - accounting is to be done with the idea that the company will never close down
<br><br>
<br>Every transaction needs monetary term - no bartering
<br><br>
<br>In the books of accounting, everything is accounted for at historical costs only
<br>No notional or market values
<br><br>
<br>whatever you're earning has to be matched - P&amp;L is accurately depicted - transactions must be accounted for when its coming in
<br><br>
<br>Accounting for things in the right period
<br><br>
<br>you will account for a transaction even if actual cash isn't coming in
<br>If it's coming in then account for it for sure
<br>receivables are accounted for when they are accounted for not when they aren't<br>
Treat every transaction in isolation<br>
receivable account exists brother
<br><br>
<br>anything that is significant enough for decision making should be disclosed separately
<br>If any transaction is above a certain threshold, it has to be shown separately in the reports - the thresholds are set by the companies act
<br>Some classifications have to be disclosed separately even if they aren't above the thresholds set by the companies act
<br>any major event has to be disclosed
<br><br>
<br>there are accounting standards - international, indian, etc.
<br>bunch of rules that tell you how to account for different stuff
<br>Although you are free to choose a standard, stick with it
<br><br>
<br>You cannot record for a notional or forseeable profit but you must record for forseeable losses
<br>Basically if you're happy, stop being happy because accounting doesn't want that
<br>inventory is products unsold by the end of the year - matching principle says what didn't get sold cannot be taken as an expense. inventory is an asset 
<br>inventory is to be valued at market value or net realizable value, whichever is lower - exception to cost principle

<br>Revenue expenditure is everything that is expense - whatever is used for day to day operations
<br><br>
<br>When the benefits of the expenditure is not exhausted in the year in which it was incurred
<br>An example of expenditures incurred is in purchase of fixed assets
<br>Faq
Assets that aren't fixed assets:

<br>Inventory
<br>Short term loans

These are called current assets
<br><br>
<br>Proprietor - the person who invests his money in the business and bears all risks connected with the business is called the proprietor
<br>Capital - It means amount invested by the proprietor in the business. For the business, capital is a liability towards the owner.
<br>Drawings - It is the amount of money taken away by the proprietor for personal use
<br><br>
<br>Debtor is someone who owns money to you - usually someone you've sold goods on credit
<br>Other terms for debtor are - receivables, trade receivables, account receivables
<br>Creditor is the person from whom the company has a debt from. Generally the vendor from whom they've bought stuff on credit
<br>Payables, trade payables, accounts payables
<br>Debtor is asset and creditor is liability
<br><br>
<br>Goods - Purchased for resale or to produce finished products which are also meant to be sold
<br>What the company trades or manufactures
<br>Companies can be classified broadly into companies that sell goods and companies that sell services
<br>In goods, companies can be classified into traders and manufacturers
<br>There'll be a purchase account for all the inward movement of goods and a sales account for the outward movement of goods
Hint
The purchase account is expense, the other effect of purchase is cash (goes down)<br>
The expense account is income and the other effect is cash (goes up)
whatever you haven't sold at the end of the accounting period, is called the closing stock, whatever is in closing stock, in the next accounting period, becomes the opening stock
"When you're buying, its expense, when you're selling it's sales, jo bachgaya hai, becomes inventory"
Inventory isn't a transaction, but since you own it, it's an asset


<br>Returns - Accounted as sales returns, when the customer doesn't like your stuff
<br>Return inward
<br>Return from you - accounted as purchase return, when you don't like your suppliers stuff 
<br>Return Outward
<br>Goods which are in the transition stage if the processing time is high is called "work in progress"
<br><br>
<br>Solvent - A person who is in a position to pay his debts as they become due
<br>Insolvent - A person who is not in a position to pay his debts as they become due
<br>When a customer doesn't have enough money to pay their dues, they are declared insolvent, you must write off this asset, call it bad debt. Non performing asset
<br>If, later on the customer gives the money, you account it as an income
<br>Following the principle of conservatism, companies are required to keep a provision for "doubtful" debts
<br><br>
<br>Wages is what is paid to the blue collar staff and salary is what is paid to the white collar staff
<br>Losses are something against which the business receives no benefit
<br>Profit -&gt; Income-Expenses
<br><br>Say soma starts a tea stall, he brings in 1000 rupees and borrows 1000 rupees. It is borrowed on the condition that at the end of every month he will have to pay 300 rupees. That's all he can borrow at the present
Soma starts with 2000 rupees. Total capital employed is 1000 rupees (owner's funds/ shareholders funds) and 1000 rupees of borrowed money (debt/borrowings)
Hot plate, vessels, crockery, etc is bought by soma for 1000 rupees. These are fixed assets.
Then He buys his raw material like tea, milk, etc. These are his stock/inventory of working capital for 500 rupees. 500 rupees is left
On day 1 he sells 100 cups of tea at 5 rupees each. The tradition in the area is that you're paid the next day. Soma hasn't received a single rupee yet but he knows he will receive tomorrow(accounts receivable)
He is left with 200 rupees worth of stock which is usable on the next day
He has hired a helper wjo will cost him 50 rupees a day. The helpers salary will be paid on a weekly basis. Besides,he has to pay 10 rupees as interest on the loan
Soma has not recieved a single penny at the end of day 1, but we know that he generated sales of 500 rupees and material cost was only 300 rupees. In other words,his gross profit was 200 rupees. Sales-direct revenue expenditure = gross profit
We are taking into account sales and expenses only without any cash coming in, this is called the accrual principle
Consider material cost on day 1. Logically,we take material cost at 300 rupees
If soma has to close his business the next day, his fixed assets will barely sell for 200 rupees, so do we take this as a loss of 800 rupees? no cus going converna and all so we gotta keep positive
If at the end of the day someone promises you that he will buy 200 cups at 6 rupees, you cant mark that as a profit cus conservatism

<br>Fixed assets- form the productive capacity for any business and are not traded in the course of the business
<br>Current assets - the ones that will get converted into cash within a regular operator cycle

<br>Nominal accounts - all accounts related to income or expenses
<br>Real accounts - Anything that can be owned - only fixed assets,stocks and cash- Whatever you can hear see, touch
<br>Personal accounts - personal account, related to an entity, like bank account, customer account, vendor account, loan taken from a bank. They are personal accounts since they represent an entity, they can be assets or liabilities
<br>Jaise sales is nomial account, customer is personal account, 
<br>Golden matrix (refer to ppt)
<br>Cash and stock are real and bank and debtors are personal
<br>Liabilities are all personal since they are all related directly to an entity

"Whatever notions you have about debit and credit, please maro CTR+ALT+DELETE"
<br>
<br>
For personal account, debit the receiver, credit the giver

<br>
For real account, debit what comes in, credit what goes out

<br>
For nominal account, debit all expenses and losses, credit all incomes and gains
Example
cash sales - sales and cash accounts. Sales is nominal, cash is real. Sales mein credit, cash mein debit


<br>
debit and credit are only accounting operators

<br><br>
<br>STep 1 - identify the accounts affected
<br>STep 2 - for each account, identify the type (real, nominal, personal)
<br>STep 3 - ask the appropriate question based on the type (questions given above) to register it as credit or debit
Done

<br>
Gross is the value, and net is the gross minus deductions<br>
Gross is usually the higher value and net is the lower value<br>

A personal account is impacted only when it is an unsettled transaction or it is a settlement of a previously unsettled transaction. The exception to this rule is the bank account, whenever you receive a cheque, it goes straight ot the bank account<br>Tip
Advance is an unsettled transaction, it's like a loan to someone 
<br>sundry means miscellaneous <br><br>
<br>The process of accounting:
<br>Identifying the event
<br>converting the event into monetary terms
<br>recording the journal entry
<br>posting to ledger account - its a place where all the accounts are kept, so that you know whether you're insolvent or not
<br>Preparing the trial balance - this is a quick check of whether your accounts are correct and you can check this using the credit and debit totalling 0. If they don't, you need to fix a few things and adjust some transactions
<br>Preparing the final acounts: Profit and loss account and balance sheet
<br><br>
<br>Usually in a business, transactions that are debited and credited are recorded in a systematic manner and the book in which they are recorded, in a chronological order is called the journal.
<br>The fields that exist in a journal- date, particulars, LF, debit, credit
<br>particulars is the account to be credited or debited and if it's to be debited, it's suffixed by Dr and if it's to be credited, its prefixed by to
<br>After a particular entry is written, a narration must be written for an audit trail
<br>LF- ledger folio, folio means page number.Once an entry is passed, it's posted in a ledger and the page it's posted on is called the LF
<br><br>The book which contains accounts is called the ledger<br>Problem

<br>These are "at the heart of critical thinking", to unde
<br>Questions for clarification: clarifying the thinking behind a certain concept - "Why do you say that?", "Could you explain further?", "How does the concentration suddenly reduce on entry of a stream to a CSTR", "Whats the blow off cock there for in a boiler?", "How does the triple product of these partial derivatives equal -1?", "Whats the physical significance of exergy, gibbs free energy, enthalpy,etc"
<br>Questions that probe assumptions - "Why is there no temperature gradient from the boundary layer to the center of the fluid in the pipe?", "Why does entropy always increase?"("just cus")
<br>Questions that probe reasons and evidence - "Could the cold vodka be cause for the antidote not neutralizing the poison?"
<br>Questions about viewpoints and perspectives - "Why don't we use exergy balance here instead of gibbs energy balance?", "Why did maxwell come up with his relations in thermodynamics? What was going on in his mind? Why did he feel the need for it?", "When should I use -this concept- over -that concept-"
<br>Questions about implications and consequences: "If I did exergy balance for this instead of energy balance, what would be different? Isn't it still correct?"
<br>Questions about the question: "What was the point of this question?", "Was that question easy?", "Would we use the concept of entropy in this question?", "How does this question relate to the lecture taken today?"
<br><br>
<br>Basically analyzing, applying standards, discriminating, information seeking, logical reasoning, predicting and transforming knowledge over different situations
<br>These actions aren't too helpful to a student since it's difficult to use this list to develop a critical understanding of a subject. This is probably for teachers to assess students and all
<br><br>
<br>For the theory, ask socratic questions (good ones)
<br>For the questions - ask another question or different calculations for the problem, think of all the ways you could solve the problem incorrectly (and why they're incorrect), think of how to make the problem easier, more difficult or more exciting, make a list of concepts taught in the problem and what the point of the problem was, vary parameters of the questions and study their consequences, try to come up with better ways of solving the problem (more elegant ways - my own addition)

 <br>A homogeneous reaction is a reaction where all reactants are of the same phase<br>
<br>rate expression is expressed as  
<br>the powers of each concentration is usually same as molecularity of that substance in the reaction for elementary reactions
<br>temperature dependency of k is  Where E is the activation energy of the reaction, R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature in kelvin. A is a factor that represents number of collisions and is also called the frequency factor
<br>As it gets more complicated, just use common sense man.
<br>Series reactions can be modeled by simply taking the each reaction and calculating the rate for every intermediate
<br>Same with parallel
<br><br>
<br>Conversion - always defined on the limiting reagant. In different situations, different elements of the reaction may be limiting and thus choosing it is not possible from just the reaction equation
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241001152222.png" src="pasted-image-20241001152222.png">
<br>The symbol for conversion is X

<br>The design equation for a batch reactor
<br>In the following derivation all subscripts refer to the reactant identity and from when the value was provided. N is moles of a substance, X is conversion, r is rate, V is volume

<br>integrate this and get what you want
<br>Batch reactors are pretty obvious really
<br><br>
<br>Unlike batch reactors, the real biggies are the continuous flow reactors that keep taking in chemicals and outputting chemicals continuously
<br>There are two types of flow reactors - plug flow and continuous stir tank reactors(AKA backmix reactors)
<br>The basic equations have symbols F = molar flow rate, C = concentration, V = control volume
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241001153708.png" src="pasted-image-20241001153708.png">

<br>This is not differential, just one block. Very simple
<br>All the contents are perfectly mixed at all times (homogeneous). The reaction happens at a concentration lower than inlet.
<br>This reactor is difficult to understand so take a minute to visualize

<br>A homogeneous reaction involves only one phase
<br>The molecularity of a reaction is how many molecules are colliding in a reaction step

<img alt="Pasted image 20240926122107.png" src="pasted-image-20240926122107.png"><br>
suppose we mix 3kg of water and 1kg of pure H2SO4 at 21.1 C adiabatically, what will the final temperature be?<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240911110600.png" src="pasted-image-20240911110600.png"><br>Info
if we actually did this isothermally, we'd have to remove energy since the total enthalpy of the mixture reduces. This is because of hydrogen bonding formed between h2so4 and h20
<br><br>
<br>The above equation can be used for any of the variables like gibbs free energy, entropy, etc
<br><br>
<br>This is a polynomial fitted for delta H mix
<br>
<br>x1 and x2 are the mole fractions of the two components
Todo
Fit a redlich kister expansion to H2SO4


<br><br>
<br>One of the things that separates chemical engineers from the rest of humanity is that we are able to separate stuff.
<br>Distillation, crystallization, liquid liquid extraction, etc.
<br>So we'll have a mixture and a process which outputs a number of pure components
<br>Now if we want to know the minimum work or heat required to separate something, we can use this
<br><br>
<br>Imagine we have a phase equilibrium between a liquid and it's vapour:
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240925112145.png" src="pasted-image-20240925112145.png">
<br>I don't know why you should imagine this I just copied this off the board
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240925113256.png" src="pasted-image-20240925113256.png">
<br>The above can be written for vapour as well
<br>the derivative of G with respect to components in the mixture is called the chemical potential of that particular component in whichever phase it's in
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240925114057.png" src="pasted-image-20240925114057.png">This is also called the partial molar gibbs energy
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240925114641.png" src="pasted-image-20240925114641.png">
<br>An interesting derivation later we see that at equilibrium, the chemical potential of each component in the liquid phase must be equal to the chemical potential of that component in the vapour phase
<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20240925121402.png" src="pasted-image-20240925121402.png"><br>
<br>Last year we had learnt that enthalpy is the addition of enthalpy multiplied by the mole fraction of each component, THIS WAS WRONG
<br>It's the partial molar enthalpy of a component multiplied by it's mole fraction and added up with all the other components - thats the actual enthalpy
<br>Gibbs duhem - get familiar
<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20240926110930.png" src="pasted-image-20240926110930.png"><br>
Now, using the Redlich Kister expansion<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240926111833.png" src="pasted-image-20240926111833.png"><br><br>
<br>N number of ideal gases are being mixed at a certain temperature 
<br>Volume change due to mixing is 0, 
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240926115354.png" src="pasted-image-20240926115354.png">
<br>This means that the partial molar volume is equal to the volume of the pure substance
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240926115840.png" src="pasted-image-20240926115840.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240926120504.png" src="pasted-image-20240926120504.png">
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240926120640.png" src="pasted-image-20240926120640.png">
Problem
Suppose we have an isothermal separation like:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240926120951.png" src="pasted-image-20240926120951.png">


<br>Solution
<img alt="Pasted image 20240926121734.png" src="pasted-image-20240926121734.png">
<br><br>
<br>The Partial Molar gibbs free energy of all components has to be the same
Problem
A problem from the green envelope

Bdababsoia eiasid<br>
The del mix when x tends to 0 also ends up tending to 0<br>Todo
I need to study sandler later today after the graph theory and all ka kaam
<br>Danger
Another problem. I am so hungry I don't think I can solve it I shouldn't have skipped breakfast
<br>
<br>
Non ideal mixture - 

<br>
Mex is the excess property of a real gas
Important
A reminder for why we are doing all this - we are doing this to get to raoults law, henry's law and solubility


<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>
You might notice a pattern here, but that's because you are stupid and actually for quantities like entropy and gibbs free energy and the sort, there is another term after the delta mix to get the excess

<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Now, using summability relation
<br>
<br>
<br>Now if we want the partial molar excess property (what a mouthful) at constant temperature, pressure and other components' moles:
<br>
<br>Now wat dis look lyk?
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>The above is for one component. The below is for multiple components
<br>
<br>The f_i bar is the fugacity of the component in the mixture, NOT the partial molar fugacity
<br>Pyi is the partial pressure of the gas
<br>
<br>
<br>=&gt;
<br>
<br>
<br><br>At equilibrium:<br>
the above only works for ideal mixtures - like the fi bar related to the pure component fugacity<br>for the non ideal condition:<br>
the a_i is the activity coefficient<br>Quote
If Prathamesh were normal, his activity coefficient would be 1/88, but since he interacts with 7 people in the class at any point in time, his activity coefficient is 7/88
<br>for vapour phase, IM:<br>
phi is the fugacity coefficient, which is the ratio of fugacity to the actual pressure<br>
since the vapour phase is an IM, it's pressure is low enough and the pressure is equal to the fugacity<br>
the exponent to e is small enough for that part of the equation to be equal to 1<br>
If liquid phase is also an ideal mixture then,<br>
Dis is raoults law<br>Danger
WHAAAA. THIS IS SO OBVIOUS WHY DID WE SPEND LIKE 5 CLASSES PROVING IT? AND NOW WE HAVE A TEST. I HATE THIS LIFE I HATE EVERYTHING AND NOW PROF SAID THAT WE WILL NEVER USE IT
<br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241009115411.png" src="pasted-image-20241009115411.png"><br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241009115634.png" src="pasted-image-20241009115634.png"><br>
<br>So now all we do is get the enthalpies of all the streams and we assume the mixing process is at steady state. The difference between the in and out enthalpies give you the heat you need to remove from the process
<br>So just mass balance and energy balance
<br>This is below our level
<br>No calculation will be done!
